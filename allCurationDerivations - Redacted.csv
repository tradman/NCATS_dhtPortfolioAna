0,GamerFit: A Digital Intervention to Improve Physical Activity and Sleep Behaviors in Youth with Psychiatric Diagnoses,"More than 1 in 4 children receive at least one psychiatric diagnosis (PD) before age 17. These youth face significantly elevated chronic disease risk including high prevalence of obesity, which is propelled by low physical activity (PA) levels, poor sleep, and social isolation. Unhealthy PA and sleep behaviors not only increase preventable chronic disease risks, they also worsen the cognitive and behavioral functioning challenges these youth experience. The goal of ""GamerFit"" is to test the delivery of a theory-based mHealth app that utilizes social support, exergaming, and telehealth coaching to improve PA levels, sleep, and psychiatric symptoms among youth participants (ages 14-17 y) with PD. In order to aid future intervention optimization, we will randomize 60 participants with at least one PD, with 30 using the GamerFit app with weekly telehealth coaching sessions and 30 using a commercial healthy habits app as a comparator group. The GamerFit app will provide access to a menu of exergames, progressive PA and sleep plan, integrated self- monitoring, pre-recorded videos addressing healthy PA and sleep habits, and motivational text messages to help users meet PA and sleep guidelines over 12 weeks. The project leverages our pilot data on exergaming and telehealth coaching to improve PA in youth with PD, and our interdisciplinary team has expertise in developmental psychology, PA and sleep intervention design, technology-based health promotion, and app development. The major research question is: Is a 12-week exergaming and telehealth coaching intervention, delivered via a smartphone app, an acceptable, feasible and effective method to improve PA and sleep behaviors in youth with PD? The specific aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1: To examine feasibility and acceptability of the 12-week GamerFit intervention delivered through a mobile app to youth with PD and their parents. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the 12-week GamerFit intervention delivered through a mobile app will improve PA levels and sleep quality and duration compared to a comparator group that uses an unstructured healthy habits tracking app. Exploratory Aims: To test the hypothesis that the 12-week GamerFit intervention delivered through a mobile app will improve mood, behavioral regulation, and perceived social isolation and support compared to the comparator group; and to test the hypothesis that behavioral effects will be sustained at week 16 (i.e. 4-weeks after the end of the intervention). We will also work with clinicians to explore approaches to incorporating the app, specifically PA prescriptions, into psychiatric treatment plans. This project impacts the field by testing the delivery of a theory- and evidence-based exergaming and telehealth coaching intervention targeting multiple health behaviors in youth with PD via a low-cost app.",R21,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10450375,R21HD106465,R21HD106465-01A1,106465,A1,,2022,1,1,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
1,Impact of Physical Activity Routines and Dietary Intake on the Longitudinal Symptom Experience of the people living with HIV (PROSPER-HIV),"People living with HIV (PLHIV) experience a disproportionately high symptom burden (e.g., fatigue, insomnia, pain) with few treatment options. These symptoms are frequent, distressing, often co-occur, and have significant consequences on the health and well-being of PLHIV, yet we know almost nothing about how to effectively mitigate them. Non-pharmacological treatment options are highly desirable for symptom management among PLHIV who already experience a high pill burden from multiple comorbid diseases. Our team previously reported that physical activity and better nutrition were associated with lower symptom intensity in PLHIV; but a clearer understanding of the effects of physical activity and diet is required to determine how these approaches can reduce symptom distress in this population. Building on these data, this project proposes to examine the effect of two promising non-pharmacological strategies, Physical Activity Routines And Dietary Intake, on the longitudinal Symptom Experience of PLHIV (PARADISE-HIV). The PARADISE-HIV study is an observational, longitudinal study that will utilize the substantial infrastructure of the Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) to examine physical activity and dietary patterns and symptom burden of 850 PLHIV over four years. This study will occur in four demographically diverse HIV clinics [Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, Ohio), University of Alabama at Birmingham (Birmingham, Alabama), University of Washington (Seattle, Washington) and Fenway Health Institute (Boston, Massachusetts)]. PARADISE-HIV will overcome the limitations of previous studies by 1) enrolling a large, demographically and geographically diverse, clinic-based sample of PLHIV, 2) examining the relationship between physical activity, dietary intake and symptom burden over time, and 3) using prospective, gold-standard measures of physical activity (i.e., triaxial accelerometry) and dietary intake (i.e., 24-hour diet recalls). Anthropomorphic and physical fitness factors will be assessed as potential mediators of physical activity and dietary intake on symptom burden and intensity. When our aims are accomplished we will have precise, definitive, high-quality data describing the impact of physical activity and diet on symptoms in PLHIV. These data can be used clinically to provide feedback to HIV health care providers on the physical activity and dietary intake of their patients. The PARADISE-HIV study will also have a significant scientific impact and will inform the next phase of this program of research. These findings will be used to develop an individually-targeted, clinic-based intervention to improve physical activity and dietary intake that will eventually reduce symptoms among PLHIV. They will also be used to examine biological and clinical mechanisms that lead to the prevalent unremitting symptoms experienced by PLHIV. Thus, the proposed study is likely to stimulate novel research that will have a long-term impact on the health and quality of life of PLHIV.",R01,NR,NINR,NR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9694958,R01NR018391,R01NR018391-01,18391,,,2018,1,1,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3,Pediatric Asthma Disparities: The Role of Sleep and Immune Balance,"This K24 application proposes a mentorship program in patient-oriented research in multi-level contributors to pediatric asthma health disparities, wih a focus on sleep and immune balance. The K24 Candidate is an Associate Professor (Research) in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior of the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, with a history of funding in behavioral interventions and longitudinal research aimed at improving asthma outcomes in urban children and addressing health disparities in pediatric asthma. Training Plan: The candidate will obtain additional training in asthma clinical immunology and sleep physiology, including state-of the art methods to assess immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep, and in-lab methods to assess sleep phenomenology through experimental approaches. Research Plan: The research proposed involves an innovative investigation of the effects of experimental sleep disruption on immune balance (Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio-Th1/Th2R; plasma IL-6 -pIL-6), and associated changes in asthma- related lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) and daytime performance in urban children with persistent asthma (8-10 years old). Forty children and their primary caregiver will each participate in a within-subjects protocol, with two experimental sleep conditions: baseline sleep (1 overnight, in-lab polysomnographic (PSG) sleep study), followed by sleep fragmentation (1 overnight, in-lab PSG). Prior to each condition, children will follow a 6-day sleep stabilization schedule at home. We will monitor sleep and lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) daily to confirm eligibility and adherence to sleep criteria, and assess asthma status. We include assessments of immune biomarkers and daytime performance following each condition. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentoring Plan: The proposed mentoring plan offers opportunities for mentorship of postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty with interests in POR. Mentees will be involved in ongoing longitudinal and intervention studies on pediatric asthma disparities, including the proposed research, which will focus on biological-based processes that contribute to asthma and sleep in urban children. A strong emphasis is placed on the recruitment and selection of minority mentees. This overall plan capitalizes on the rich resources and training opportunities available to postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty at Brown Medical School, including several T32 fellowship programs, numerous junior faculty with K awards and small grants, a commitment to diversity in training, seminars in research design, ethics, and statistics, and an established infrastructure for evaluation.",K24,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9012263,K24HL130451,K24HL130451-01,130451,,,2016,1,2,,,,,,,,,,
30,Using supportive text messages to improve outcomes for adolescents in alcohol and other drug treatment,"Alcohol and other drug (AOD) misuse is a major health and safety problem that most commonly begins during adolescence. AOD use during adolescence can lead to many short- and long-term negative consequences including altered academic and employment trajectories, incarceration, susceptibility to future drug problems, cortical damage, and impaired adult cognitive functioning. Relapse prevention is currently the standard treatment for adolescent AOD users who have chosen abstinence. Reminders of one's commitment to abstinence, such as alarm clocks and calendars, can serve as support mechanisms for relapse prevention. With the advent of newer technology (e.g., smart-phones), the potential arises to update these reminder mechanisms. Because adolescents are often first adopters of new technology, new reminder methods may be particularly effective with them. Research on applying technology to substance abuse treatment has focused on the effect of text-message interventions for individuals not seeking treatment. We are aware of no studies investigating the effect of texting as a support mechanism for substance abuse relapse prevention. The current study proposes to apply text messages as a supportive reminder and adjunct to substance abuse counseling with adolescents. Three groups (N = 150) will be compared: a group of youth who self-select their messages (N = 50), a yoked group who are assigned messages (N = 50), and a treatment as usual control condition (N = 50). Messages will be sent in a random order and at randomized time intervals for four weeks. Data collected through this study will examine the impact of text message content on relapse rates. Data also will be gathered to measure the impact of the messages on self-efficacy and receptivity of youth to these messages. These data will provide preliminary findings necessary for continued research on the utility of technology in clinical practice and provide training to a promising young researcher.",F31,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,6,1,No,Awarded,9256787,F31AA025531,F31AA025531-01,25531,,,2016,1,18,Chris,,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
45,Randomized study of daytime vs. delayed eating: Effect on weight and metabolism,"Of the many factors contributing to the obesity epidemic, timing of food consumption is now recognized for its significant contribution to body weight regulation. Disruption of sleep-wake cycles from a predominantly diurnal lifestyle to a nocturnal lifestyle leads to abnormal circadian rhythms and metabolic dysfunction. We have also reported that night eating syndrome, characterized by a delayed pattern of eating, is associated with weight gain and disruption of neuroendocrine rhythms without sleep-wake cycle changes. Studies in night- active rodents have shown that restriction of feeding to the light period leads t profound changes in the circadian rhythms of leptin, insulin, corticosterone, and thyroxine, and a propensity toward obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. However, the metabolic effects of a predominantly daytime versus delayed eating pattern, using an experimental design, have not been well studied in humans. We hypothesize that a delayed pattern of eating, while keeping sleep-wake and activity levels constant, will produce an increase in weight and an abnormal metabolic response in healthy patients. A total of 20 healthy men and women with a BMI of 20 - 27 kg/m2 will be recruited for a randomized cross-over experiment testing two eating conditions. The first condition, daytime eating, would consist of three meals and two snacks to be consumed between 0800 h and 1800 h. The second condition, delayed eating, would consist of three meals and two snacks consumed between 1200 h and 2200 h. Energy and macronutrient content will be comparable between these eating conditions, and sleep-wake period would be held constant between 2300 h and 0700 h. Voluntary exercise will be held constant between conditions. Each participant would be free-living and supplied food from our metabolic kitchen for two months for the first condition, followed by a two-week wash out period eating as they usually would, followed by two months on the second condition (order randomly assigned). Adherence to the protocol will be monitored closely with food logs, pre- and post- weighing of food, use of pictures sent via electronic devices for portion size assessment, actigraphy, and self- reports for sleep-wake and physical activity monitoring. The assessment battery will occur at four points: 1) baseline; 2) after the first 2-mo eating condition; 3) after he 2-wk washout, before starting the second eating condition; and 4) after the second 2-mo eating condition. At each point body composition will be measured with DEXA and indirect calorimetry will be performed. We will measure fasting levels of lipids, triglycerides, and fatty acids. Glucose, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, cortisol, and melatonin will be measured at 0800h, 1200 h, 1600 h, 2000 h, and 0400 h. We will compare the effects of the eating conditions on weight, adiposity, energy metabolism, and hormonal markers. The study will be performed under free-living conditions to increase generalizability. The results obtained from this R21 funded project will establish feasibility for a larger R01 application. The project will benefit frm the expertise of the investigators in eating behaviors, sleep and circadian biology, and neuroendocrinology and metabolism, and has potentially broad clinical implications for promotion of healthy eating habits that could influence weight and metabolic health in the general population.",R21,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8879128,R21DK100787,R21DK100787-02,100787,,,2015,2,23,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
49,Physical Activity to Improve CV Health in Older Women: A Pragmatic Trial -- DCC,"The number of Americans aged 65 and older is projected to double to 88.5 million by 2050 (55% women). The significant aging of the U.S. population creates a public health mandate to identify effective interventions for preserving the health and independence of older people, especially women. Compelling evidence over the past several decades supports the importance of physical activity (PA) for preventing cardiovascular (CV) and other chronic diseases, and preserving physical and cognitive health, in older adults. Yet, despite the steady emergence of evidence-based interventions for increasing PA in older adults, which could potentially be delivered at a population level, we lack large-scale randomized trial data showing that these interventions can prevent clinical CV events or impact the public's health. To address this critical gap, we propose to conduct a large-scale, randomized controlled pragmatic trial, the Women's Health Initiative Strong & Healthy (WHISH) trial. This pragmatic trial will be embedded in the large, race/ethnicity diverse, WHI Extension cohort, now aged 63-99 years, which is both novel and resource-efficient. The trial will test the hypothesis that a centralized public health intervention designed to increase and/or maintain PA to levels recommended for older U.S. adults will reduce major CV events (e.g., myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and CVD death) in older women over ~4 years of follow-up. The study will also evaluate the safety of the intervention by examining risks of total clinical fracture, hi fracture, falls, and non-CVD mortality. Preliminary screening indicates that 50,500 WHI women will meet eligibility criteria; the PA intervention and ""usual activity"" comparison groups will eac contain ~25,250 participants (mean age ~80 years). We will use a randomized consent design, with the observational comparison group and non-consenters followed as usual within the WHI Extension study. The WHISH intervention builds upon evidence-based, state-of-the-science behavioral approaches and intervention components that have proven to be effective in increasing PA in older women, with innovative adaptive strategies to tailor the intervention. We will use an algorithm-driven interactive voice response (IVR) system, a technology of increasing familiarity to older adults, built to complement National Institute on Aging (NIA) Go4Life(R) Exercise & Physical Activity materials. The evidence-based IVR system provides tailored advice, with personalized feedback and a means for self-monitoring (logging activity) and personal goal setting. PA behavior will be monitored by self-reported questionnaire and an accelerometry substudy in both study groups. Based on observed rates in the WHI cohort, we project 80% power to detect a 12.5% effect size for major CV events over the follow-up period. The WHI infrastructure, combined with innovative, evidence-based methods to deliver the PA intervention at a population level, provides a unique opportunity to address the critical question, ""Can a public health PA intervention reduce CVD events in older women?""

60,A Therapeutic Wearable Sensor for Dysphagia,": Of the 42 million individuals worldwide with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), 13% to 57% (5.5 to 24 million individuals) suffer dysphagia or swallowing problems. The sequelae of dysphagia in this vulnerable population include malnutrition, dehydration, and aspiration pneumonia. Since swallowing and breathing share a common anatomical pathway, precise coordination is critical. In normal individuals, swallowing occurs in a well-regulated period between mid-to-late respiratory expiration, which imparts airway protective benefits. In dysphagia, this respiratory-swallowing coordination is lost. Despite the high prevalence of dysphagia in individuals with dementia and the seriousness of the consequences, there are limited diagnostic and therapeutic modalities available. The current standard of care for dysphagia in ADRD is behavioral swallowing therapy with specially-trained speech-language pathologists. Specifically, our research team has recently pioneered a novel cross-system training approach with 4-8 in-clinic sessions that directly optimizes respiratory-swallow timing (RST) through visual biofeedback. However, this training must be done in-clinic and requires large, expensive, bulky, and multi-wired systems. Carry over of functional improvements is impeded by the absence in-home training. New technologies addressing dysphagia specifically ADRD requires significant user-centric design, straightforward operation that is deployable at home with minimal caretaker burden, and robustness. We have previously developed a soft, flexible, and fully wireless throat-deployed wearable sensor capable of continuously tracking respiration and swallowing. We propose adding a vibratory haptic motor to enable a home-based therapy that recapitulates RST therapy after therapist training. This new therapeutic wearable would vibrate gently to stimulate swallowing at home as a strengthening exercise whenever a minimum threshold of swallowing is not met. In addition, the device provides additional feedback that reinforces safe swallows personalized to the wearer's unique expiratory cadence. First, we will conduct focus groups to enable user-centric design. Then, we propose to validate this sensor in a small cohort of persons with mild AD (Clinician Dementia RatingTM≤1). Finally, we will evaluate acceptance of the sensor in a short home trial. This proposal aligns with NIA priorities for this RFA, which aims to develop assistive technologies that are innovative, efficacious, scalable, and low-cost",R41,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9680570,R41AG062023,R41AG062023-01,62023,,,2018,1,34,Leonie,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
64,COVID-19 shutdown: impact of healthcare disruptions on cardiovascular health disparities among people with multiple chronic conditions in New York City.,"In the first half of 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic infected nearly 4 million persons in the U.S. and caused over 150,000 deaths. In the midst of the early phase of this pandemic, people with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia, which are increasingly common with age, were left extremely vulnerable to disruptions in healthcare delivery; in New York City (NYC), the first U.S. epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, traditional ambulatory care ceased entirely for several months and then reopened at only limited capacity. Implementation of telemedicine and modified in-person visits to bridge this gap was attempted but adopted unevenly, and differential uptake may have worsened existing health disparities. In this context, the unprecedented pandemic-disruption in ambulatory care in NYC provides a singular opportunity to study the long-term effects of disasters on health care systems serving health disparity populations. Our institution, NYU Grossman School of Medicine (NYUGSOM), is uniquely positioned to answer these questions, having been at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC. We have robust existing data partnerships with the INSIGHT Clinical Research Network, which includes a standardized electronic health record (EHR) network of 5 NYC academic medical centers, and with the NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation (NYC-H+H), the largest public hospital system in the U.S. We will leverage these 2 sources to determine, among people age ≥50 with MCCs (≥2 chronic medical conditions), whether patterns of health system engagement during the acute pandemic disruption phase (3/7/20-7/9/2020) influenced trajectories of 2 chronic diseases (hypertension and diabetes) at 2 years, risk of cardiovascular events at 4 years, and whether disparities in engagement exacerbated health inequities. In Aim 1 we will characterize ambulatory healthcare utilization and quantify disruptions in healthcare services (total disruption vs. delayed care vs. sufficient care) during the acute pandemic phase, overall and by subgroup (e.g. racial/ethnic minority, economically disadvantaged). In Aim 2 we will then assess the impact of total disruption and delayed care in healthcare on 2-year trajectories of chronic disease measures (mean systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c), and in Aim 3 we will measure the impact of healthcare disruptions on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the 4 years after the acute pandemic period, and identify their impacts on disparities in CVD outcomes using causal mediation analysis methods. Our findings will guide future disaster preparedness planning and allow health care systems to develop optimal care models to mitigate CVD risk and avoid worsening disparities among socioeconomically disadvantaged and/or minority populations.

70,Online Prediction of Gait Related Trips Post-Stroke,"For individuals recovering from a stroke, injurious falls often occur due to a stumble, or ""intrinsically generated"" trip (i.e., the swinging foot contacts the ground), while walking. A major barrier toward developing effective fall prevention strategies is an inability to determine reliably, in advance, that a walking-related trip will occur. Swing limb motion, however, is dictated by late stance kinematics. Therefore, we propose to develop a novel inference system, based on stance phase kinematics, that can accurately and reliably predict, in real-time, that a trip is about to occur. Thus, if the foot is predicted to strike the ground, the algorithm will inform which steps require intervention in the swing limb's trajectory. Current approaches to fall prevention teach reactive responses to a trip or train individuals post-stroke to minimize the impairments associated with falls (e.g., strength, balance, ROM). Although preventive training can reduce intrinsically generated trips for otherwise healthy older adults, deficits in voluntary muscle activation limits the efficacy of such training in individuals post-stroke. Rather than using a conventional reactive approach, we intend to develop the preliminary tools needed to develop a proactive, integrated, feed-forward controller to inform future engineering approaches (e.g., a multi-channel electrical stimulator, exoskeleton/exosuit) to appropriately intervene in the swing limb's trajectory, only when necessary. The work proposed here is a necessary first step to determine that we can successfully predict trips accurately and with sufficient time to intervene appropriately. To accomplish this goal, we will pursue two Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will use non-environmental distractors to increase the likelihood of participants experiencing an intrinsically generated trip while walking on both a treadmill, as well as overground. We will then use the recorded limb kinematics to select a feature set for development of a novel inference prediction system. This algorithm will be evaluated offline to determine its accuracy and speed in classifying steps as either trips or non-trips. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the developed inference system in a real-time analysis of trip and non-trip steps during walking. Again, the online system will be evaluated for accuracy and speed during walking trials. At the conclusion of this project, we will have a robust method of detecting an upcoming trip for ""selective"" intervention in swing limb trajectory. This work promises to have a tremendous impact on the field of walking recovery post-stroke and for other populations at risk for trip related falls. In particular, successful completion of this project will establish a paradigm shift from reactive fall prevention to proactive trip and fall prevention.",R21,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9895282,R21HD098570,R21HD098570-01A1,98570,A1,,2019,1,39,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
78,Effectiveness and implementation of text messaging to improve HIV testing in sexual and gender minority adolescents,"Adolescent sexual minority males, transgender girls, and gender diverse teens (ASMM/TGD; ages 13-18) are disproportionately affected by HIV, accounting for 79% of new infections among this age group. Although CDC and USPTF recommend HIV screening among teens, testing rates among ASMM/TGD are very low (1 in 4 ASMM; <1 in 10 TGD). Increasing HIV testing in ASMM/TGD is critical in mitigating transmission rates and in linkage to care for those who test positive. Despite this alarming public health issue, few developmentally tailored HIV prevention interventions exist for ASMM/TGD, and to date, no CDC best-evidence interventions for this group are focused on increasing HIV testing as a primary outcome. G2G was a 6-week text message-based HIV risk behavior reduction program originally designed for ASMM. Active treatment arm content focused on providing HIV prevention information, increasing HIV prevention motivation, and increasing HIV prevention self- efficacy relative to an information-only healthy lifestyle control arm. The G2G pilot RCT showed adolescents in the active treatment arm were >3x more likely to report being tested for HIV at follow-up versus those in the control arm, even though only a minority of messages focused on testing. We propose to update G2G with the latest HIV prevention and testing science, make content inclusive of TGD, and test its effectiveness on the outcome of validated HIV testing (e.g., photo of test result). Moreover, widespread adoption of digital HIV prevention programs has lagged due to lack of attention to implementation throughout software development, intervention design, and testing. For instance, who should implement digital HIV prevention/testing interventions for teens (e.g., direct-to-consumer, clinics) remains an open question, and involving potential implementers in the development process can ensure intervention success; best practices for updating content and technology for digital HIV prevention/testing programs to prevent their obsolescence are lacking; and there is a lack of consensus on how best to reach SGM adolescents for such programs. We propose a Hybrid Type 1 trial that will establish G2G effectiveness and identify best practices for implementing digital HIV prevention/testing for teens via three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will collaborate with a youth advisory council to add content reflecting our increased emphasis on HIV testing and update gender inclusivity and cultural relevance of existing content. With prospective implementers' input, we will also modernize the G2G software platform with an eye toward implementation. In Aim 2 we will test G2G effectiveness on HIV testing in a nationwide randomized controlled trial with 360 ASMM/TGD aged 13-18. Finally, Aim 3 will convene a experts in ASMM/TGD youth research and service provision to identify and achieve consensus in processes of, requirements for, and barriers/facilitators to reaching and engaging ASMM/TGD for HIV testing/prevention. The goal of Aim 3 is to inform, develop, and disseminate concrete tools to ensure HIV prevention programs reach ASMM/TGD.

94,Center for Solutions for ME/CFS,"Overall Abstract The Center for Solutions for ME/CFS (CfS for ME/CFS) is an inter-disciplinary, inter-institutional center comprised of clinicians, clinical investigators, basic scientists who are committing to working together to understand the pathogenesis of ME/CFS and develop evidence-based strategies for interventions that prevent and mitigate disease. The team initially coalesced with an NIH call to respond to spurious reports linking xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) to ME/CFS. It consolidated its vision with support from the Hutchins Family Foundation Chronic Fatigue Initiative (CFI) and a crowd-funding organization, The Microbe Discovery Project, to explore the role of infection and immunity in disease and identify biomarkers for diagnosis through functional genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic discovery. The foundation for this project is a large clinical database and sample repository representing oral, fecal, and blood samples from well-characterized ME/CFS subjects and frequency-matched controls collected nationwide over a period of several years. In Project 1, we survey for the presence of molecular footprints of bacterial, fungal, and viral agents and corresponding immune responses in a 100 case/100 control subset of repository samples using high throughput sequencing, high density peptide arrays, and immune signature assays; this Project also examines the prevalence of autoantibodies selected based on clinical and literature reports. In Project 2, we profile the plasma metabolome and PBMC transcriptome in the same subjects studied in Project 1 using state-of-the-art mass spectrometric and RNA-seq methods, comprehensive mass spectral libraries, and tools for RNA profiling in bulk cell populations using cell sub-type specific markers. We also pursue metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses after orthostatic and exercise challenges using samples collected in Project 3. In Project 3, we mine existing databases at Columbia and the CFI for insights into clinical features, comorbidities, and sub-types that can be used to refine laboratory analyses, as well as enhance patient care. We will work with clinicians and the ME/CFS community to design a mobile app that will allow patients and caregivers to track clinical status in response to stressors and interventions, and will provide prospective research data. We will also investigate the utility of the Lean Test as a simple outpatient test for autonomic function.",U54,AI,NIAID,AI,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9479907,U54AI138370,U54AI138370-01,138370,,,2017,1,52,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
96,Development and Validation of Mechanically Compliant Wearable Monitoring Systems for Swallowing Function and Disorders,"/ABSTRACT 2 3 Rural areas often experience shortages of medical professionals and technologies. Such shortages 4 significantly affect patient health and outcomes, justifying investments in tele-rehabilitation technology to 5 deliver these services remotely. Modern technologies enable the use of portable monitoring systems, 6 facilitating clinicians to remotely collect biofeedback signals for rehabilitation practices and enabling patients to 7 use real-time biofeedback. However, existing devices suffer from rigid or semi-flexible platforms, which are not 8 suited for interfacing with the soft, curvilinear, and dynamic parts of the human body (e.g., the submental 9 (under the chin) and intraoral areas). This often results in poor data acquisition and in discomfort, thereby 10 affecting patient compliance. Moreover, poor treatment compliance is identified as a critical barrier to 11 rehabilitation, and is primarily attributed to expensive, difficult-to-use or limited availability of equipment/devices, 12 and inability to physically access treatment. This team's long-term goal is to provide a complete set of 13 advanced wearable devices that can be easily and accurately utilized for day-to-day tele-rehabilitation needs. 14 The objective of this project is to develop and start validating a collection of inexpensive soft, thin monitoring 15 systems that can perfectly fit into/on the human body, and then wirelessly provide accurate real-time data to 16 patients and clinicians. Two curvilinear and structurally complex areas of the human body, the submental and 17 intraoral areas, will be targeted for the development of these novel, wearable transducers. Measurements from 18 these areas are essential during rehabilitation of swallowing, a vital body function that is used as the model for 19 this proposal. Swallowing disorders (dysphagia) are common in many diseases (e.g., head and neck cancer, 20 stroke, etc.) and significantly affect health, quality of life, and social integration. To accurately monitor 21 swallowing signals, intimate attachment of sensors to the anatomically challenging head/neck skin and intra- 22 oral environment is essential. To attain the stated objective, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) to 23 develop and conduct benchtop testing of a wireless soft, thin sensor patch tailored for submental muscle 24 monitoring, 2) to develop and conduct benchtop testing of a wireless palatal plate sensor tailored for intraoral 25 pressure/movement monitoring, and 3) to conduct iterative pre-clinical experiments in healthy adults to validate 26 the safety, ease-of-use/comfort, and signal quality of the sensors during swallowing tasks and exercises. The 27 proposed research is innovative, as it will develop novel, wearable tele-monitoring systems that are tailored for 28 two challenging areas anatomically. This contribution will be significant because it will offer a first-of-its-kind, 29 mechanically compliant, inexpensive, and reliable wearable system for swallowing signals monitoring. This 30 work will then form the basis for developing dysphagia tele-rehabilitation protocols and completing a follow-up 31 clinical trial. Upon project completion, a foundational platform will have been established that can be extended 32 to a range of disorders, including speech and oral sensorimotor disorders.",R21,EB,NIBIB,EB,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9669317,R21EB026099,R21EB026099-01A1,26099,A1,,2019,1,53,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
116,Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,"One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention - a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach.",R21,EB,NIBIB,EB,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9724645,R21EB027852,R21EB027852-01,27852,,,2019,1,63,Leonie,,,,,,,,,

128,Multimodal Mobile Intervention Application (app) to Address Symptoms in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Survivors,"Overview: The goal of this study is to develop, refine, and test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a self- administered, mobile sexual dysfunction intervention application (app) in improving outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) survivors. Background: Sexual dysfunction is the most common complication post-HCT with over 40% of male and 60% of female survivors reporting long-term sexual dysfunction post-transplant. Importantly, sexual dysfunction is associated with worse quality of life (QOL), relationship dissatisfaction, and psychological distress, which further contributes to the morbidity in this population. HCT survivors experience a unique and wide range of biologic, interpersonal, psychological, and social factors that impact their sexual function. Given the multifactorial nature of sexual dysfunction, a multimodal approach is necessary to address patients' specific issues and concerns. Despite the increasing use of HCT and the burden of sexual dysfunction in this often young patient population, there are currently no interventions to address their sexual dysfunction. We completed a pilot study in which we recruited HCT survivors with sexual dysfunction causing distress to participate in a multimodal intervention that entailed monthly visits with trained study nurse practitioners. We demonstrated that the intervention was feasible and led to statistically and clinically significant improvements in patients' satisfaction and interest in sex, sexual health and function, QOL, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Despite the success of our prior work, the majority of HCT survivors will not have access to clinicians with expertise to address their sexual dysfunction. Research Plan: We propose to adapt our sexual health intervention to a mobile app, which patients can self- administer via tablet computer to ensure the accessibility and scalability of the intervention. We recently secured funds to develop a multimodal mobile app to address sexual dysfunction in HCT survivors. The proposed R21 project will use mixed qualitative and quantitative methods to 1) refine the app based on an open pilot study with six HCT survivors experiencing sexual dysfunction and 2) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the mobile app versus enhanced standard care in 80 HCT survivors to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the mobile app in improving patient-reported sexual function, QOL, and mood. Environment: This project will be conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cancer Center, which cares for over 1000 HCT survivors and conducts over 200 transplants per year. Dr. El-Jawahri will collab- orate with a nationally recognized team of researchers in supportive and palliative care research, behavioral intervention development, engineering, and sexual health. Relevance of Research: This project will test an innovative, patient-centered, mobile app that will substantially enhance the care of HCT survivors and has the potential for easy dissemination and wide utilization.",R21,NR,NINR,NR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9824010,R21NR018234,R21NR018234-01A1,18234,A1,,2019,1,69,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
134,Knowledge and Usage of Lactation using Education and Advice from Support Network (KULEA-NET),"Breastfeeding has the potential to reduce health disparities associated with infant mortality and morbidity. Breastfeeding rates by ethnicity in the United States show a marked disparity in African-American (AA) women as compared to other groups. Barriers to breastfeeding are complex with literature citing a lack of knowledge, poor family and social support, inhibiting social norms/embarrassment in public, lactation problems, and limited access to health services as factors. In this Phase 1 STTR study, our multi-PI team proposes to develop KULEA-NET, a comprehensive, integrated mHealth platform that is designed to address the complex challenges of increasing breastfeeding in AA women by promoting breastfeeding initiation and supporting exclusive breastfeeding for six months. The 9- month project includes a health advisory panel, focus group sessions, mobile application design, development, and pilot testing of KULEA-NET at Medstar Washington Hospital Center. Our team includes expertise in maternal and child health, perinatal nursing, lactation, public policy, quantitative and qualitative methodology, and mobile development. The long-term product goal is to develop KULEA-NET to be user-friendly, culturally-relevant, and context- aware mobile platform available to African-American mothers.

144,Developing an artificial intelligence-based mHealth intervention to increase HIV testing in Malaysia,"HIV testing jumpstarts entry into the HIV prevention and treatment cascade. HIV testing levels, however, are especially low in men who have sex with men (MSM), who increasingly contribute to heightened HIV transmission in the presence of high levels of stigma and discrimination. For high risk MSM, new guidelines recommend frequent HIV testing, ranging from every 3 to 6 months. Yet, HIV testing in MSM often occurs less frequently due to individual (e.g., heightened concerns about risk disclosure), clinic (e.g., confidentiality breaches, and discrimination from healthcare providers) and policy (criminalization of same-sex sexual behaviors) barriers. HIV prevalence in MSM in Malaysia has soared to 21.6% nationally, exceeding 40.9% in Kuala Lumpur. While surveillance surveys of MSM in Malaysia who meet criteria for PrEP suggest that ever tested is 70.3%, past- year tested is 40.9%, and only 9.5% were tested more than 1 time per year, despite extraordinary levels of self- reported risk. Once tested, however, MSM with HIV in Malaysia are likely to be treated with ART and achieve viral suppression, making HIV testing a central focus for HIV prevention and treatment. Innovative strategies that motivate and provide guidance for testing among MSM in Malaysia are therefore urgently needed. Intervening using Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IBM) model is ideally suited to overcome barriers to recommended HIV testing in MSM. Moreover, in settings like Malaysia where the HIV epidemic has transitioned from primarily concentrated in PWID to a volatile epidemic in MSM, theory-guided behavioral change strategies that inform, motivate and provide pragmatic skills to more fully engage in recommended HIV testing are poised to accelerate the HIV prevention and care continuum. Given that there are many individual, clinic and policy barriers to HIV testing, mobile health (mHealth) interventions that reduce ""in person"" contact and offer a menu of behavioral skills is ideally suited to increase access to MSM in highly stigmatized settings and promote recommended HIV testing. Recent studies in the U.S., China, South Africa, and Peru show that mHealth interventions using smartphones and apps have the potential to increase HIV testing while maintaining MSM's confidentiality. Such mHealth interventions are feasible and acceptable among MSM, including in Malaysia where most MSM find sexual partners using social-networking apps with similar interfaces and functionalities to the proposed intervention. Current mHealth strategies, however, are limited by their lack of automation and need for high-intensity and sustained human inputs, which restricts their scale-up. Artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) may overcome such limitations, but has yet to be applied to mHealth-based HIV testing algorithms. We therefore aim to develop and pilot test an AI-chatbot (R21 phase). Findings from the R21 phase will inform a Type 1 Hybrid Implementation Science trial (R33 phase) to evaluate the efficacy and implementation outcomes of the AI-chatbot for HIV testing relative to treatment as usual.",R21,TW,FIC,TW;OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10064898,R21TW011663,R21TW011663-01,11663,,,2020,1,77,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
145,Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System,"AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum. Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (""EC-DBN""), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ]",R43,NS,NINDS,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9621149,R43NS098840,R43NS098840-01A1,98840,A1,,2018,1,73,,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
146,A Text Messaging Intervention for Smoking Cessation Among Community Health Center Patients,"Tobacco cessation rates in the U.S. have changed little in the last decade. New interventions for smoking cessation are clearly needed. Text messaging has been identified as a promising modality for delivering smoking cessation support. There is little existing research which examines models that integrate text messaging interventions for smoking cessation within healthcare systems. Healthcare systems are important sites for delivering smoking cessation support given that 70% of smokers visit a physician each year. Integrating services within healthcare enables coordination of behavioral and pharmacologic interventions and leverages patient-provider relationships. Poor adherence to smoking cessation medications is thought to limit their effectiveness. Text-messaging has been used to promote adherence to medication in other condition but the use of text messaging to promote smoking cessation medication is not well studied. The proposed scientific program has two research aims: (1) To conduct qualitative focus groups among smokers (n=30) in community health centers to assess their preferences for text messaging from their healthcare provider and to explore their experience with nicotine replacement therapy and barriers to medication adherence in order to inform the design of a text messaging intervention, and (2) To test, in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N=106), the effect of delivering behavioral smoking cessation content with pharmacotherapy support by text message plus nicotine replacement therapy on self-reported quit attempts (intentional non-smoking for =24 hours), pharmacotherapy adherence, and biochemically confirmed smoking abstinence at the end of treatment. The principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that includes methodological training and mentorship by Harvard faculty to design and evaluate a text messaging intervention targeting smokers in community health centers. The long-term goal of this career development award is to develop Gina Kruse M.D., M.S., M.P.H. as an independent tobacco cessation researcher with expertise in technology-based solutions for vulnerable populations. During the five-year award period, she will develop a knowledge base that supports the development, implementation, and evaluation of a text messaging intervention for smoking cessation among primary care patients. Career development activities will include training in qualitative research, use of mobile technologies as a communication method for delivering health advice, and clinical trial design. This proposal addresses important gaps in the literature including the feasibility of integrating text messaging programs for smokers into healthcare systems and examining the effect of text messaging on smoking cessation medication adherence.",K23,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8968023,K23DA038717,K23DA038717-01A1,38717,A1,,2015,1,78,Chris,,,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
151,Harvest for Health in Older Cancer Survivors,"Harvest for Health in Older Cancer Survivors There are close to 15 million cancer survivors in the U.S., and the majority are 65 years of age or older. Despite improvements in treatment and 5-year cure rates, cancer survivors are at greater risk for second malignancies, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and functional impairment - downstream effects that result in an annual cost of approximately $130 billion each year. Cancer survivorship has been claimed a national priority, with a call to develop effective interventions that can prevent, delay, or mitigate the adverse effects and comorbidities attendant with cancer and its treatment. Strong evidence exists that a healthful diet and regular physical activity can prevent many chronic diseases and improves physical functioning. But, more research is needed to develop interventions that can produce long-term adherence to healthful lifestyle behaviors. This study builds on strong, R21-supported preliminary data, and relies on the extant infrastructure of the Cooperative Extension Master Gardener Program. A total of 426 older (≥65 yrs.) survivors of a loco-regionally staged cancer with a good prognosis (≥ 80% 5-yr. survival) and with at least one physical function limitation will be recruited throughout Alabama and randomized to 1-of-2 study arms: 1) one that receives a 1-year mentored vegetable gardening intervention that pairs a cancer survivor with a certified Master Gardener; or 2) a wait-list control arm that receives the intervention after a 1-year delay. All participants will be followed for 2 years. This randomized controlled trial aims to: 1) determine the efficacy of the vegetable gardening intervention on fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity AND physical function (assessed by self-report and backed by objective measures: plasma α-carotene, accelerometry, and performance testing); 2) assess effects of the intervention on secondary endpoints, e.g., quality of life, biomarkers of successful aging (interleukin-6 and telomerase); 3) evaluate the durability and repeatability of the intervention; 4) explore participant factors related with program efficacy (e.g., gender, co-morbidity, age); and 5) perform an economic analysis to assess the value of health improvements relative to intervention costs. The proposed home-based, vegetable gardening intervention (using raised beds or Earthboxes® - depending on survivors' living arrangements) is a novel and feasible strategy to improve dietary intake, physical activity, and physical functioning in cancer survivors at high risk for cancer-related morbidity - one that has great clinical and public health significance given the increasing number of cancer survivors and the high economic and societal costs associated with comorbid disease. Moreover, the infrastructure for sustainability and wide-scale dissemination already exists as there are Master Gardener Programs in all 50 United States, and the proposed intervention could easily be implemented in states with 2 or more growing seasons (72% of states, plus the District of Columbia), thus reaching the vast majority of older cancer survivors (roughly 10.8 million) who reside in the temperate zones of this nation.",R01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9175256,R01CA201362,R01CA201362-01A1,201362,A1,,2016,1,76,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
162,Mobile Application Intervention Targeting the High Risk Drinking Practice of Prepartying,"The proposed research project addresses the public health concern of heavy drinking among college students by developing and testing an innovative mobile-based application to target the specific dangerous drinking behavior known as prepartying, a risky behavior practiced by upwards of 85% of college students. Prepartying involves fast-paced heavy drinking in residence halls or off-campus residences prior to going out for the night where students inevitably drink even more. Findings from over 80 prepartying studies suggest the behavior is perhaps the riskiest known college drinking behavior, leading to consequences during the prepartying event, to continued drinking and consequences after prepartying events, and to greater global levels of drinking and alcohol-related problems. Yet the lack of interventions directly targeting prepartying represents a major gap in the college student drinking research field, as such an approach could address and reduce the behavior known to be the greatest risk. For the proposed study, we will develop and test a prepartying-specific brief mobile-app intervention that is intended to help students reduce their prepartying behavior. We first develop the intervention content based on theory and research supporting mechanisms of change in brief interventions with college students and document normative drinking information from 500 college students for inclusion in the intervention content. We then beta test the intervention with a sample of 14 heavy drinking college students. Focus group feasibility and acceptability feedback will inform the final intervention content, as well as help us refine study procedures. We will then pilot test the mobile-based intervention in a randomized controlled trial of 500 college students who preparty frequently (n = 250 intervention, n = 250 attention control) and determine the efficacy of the intervention on (1) preventing heavy consumption levels and consequences during and after prepartying in the immediate term (i.e., pre-intervention two weeks to post-intervention two weeks), and on (2) reducing students' global levels of heavy drinking and consequences one and three months post-intervention. Lastly, we will evaluate hypothesized moderators known to contribute to greater risk during prepartying; mainly, that female students, students under age 21, heavier drinkers, and those motivated to change their drinking will benefit the most from the intervention. We will test a hypothesized effect that changes in prepartying drinking post-intervention (baseline to one-month) will explain changes observed in global drinking and consequences from baseline to three-month post-intervention. This prepartying-specific approach expands on global interventions and improves upon promising event-specific approaches that only focus on infrequently occurring events (e.g., 21st birthdays, spring break) by targeting the popular behavior that precedes multiple drinking contexts and directly leads to further drinking and problems. By intervening at the potential source of concern, this first-ever prepartying intervention has the potential to greatly change the culture of heavy college drinking.",R34,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9600466,R34AA025968,R34AA025968-01A1,25968,A1,,2018,1,86,Pablo,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
164,A Mobile Health Behavioral Pain Intervention Protocol for Breast Cancer Patients with Pain in Medically Underserved Communities: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"The efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) behavioral cancer pain intervention designed to decrease pain and disability for breast cancer patients in medically underserved areas has not been investigated. The long-term goal of this work is to use mHealth technologies to facilitate wide-spread implementation of an efficacious behavioral cancer pain intervention - a non-pharmacological approach to pain management. The proposed project's objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of an innovative mobile health Pain Coping Skills Training (mPCST-Community) designed to meet the needs of breast cancer patients with pain in medically underserved areas. mPCST-Community addresses intervention barriers for patients in medically underserved areas as it is delivered with video-conferencing in the patients' community based oncology clinic by a remote therapist, is extended to the patients' home environment using simple mHealth technology, and is low-literacy adapted. The central hypothesis is that mPCST-Community will result in decreased pain compared to a mHealth education attention control group (mHealth-Ed). The rationale of this proposal is that if mPCST-Community is shown to be efficacious it will rapidly increase intervention access for individuals who receive their oncology care in medically underserved areas and ultimately reduce pain-related suffering. Guided by strong preliminary data, a randomized controlled trial will be used to pursue three specific aims: 1) Test the extent to which the mPCST-Community intervention reduces pain, fatigue, disability, and distress, 2) Examine self-efficacy and pain catastrophizing as mediators through which the mPCST-Community leads to reductions in pain, fatigue, disability, and distress, and 3) To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mPCST-Community. For Aim 1, based on the study team's extensive work demonstrating the efficacy of in-person pain coping skills training protocols and pilot work showing promise for mPCST-Community, it is expected that mPCST-Community will lead to decreased pain as well as fatigue, disability, and distress compared to mHealth-Ed. For Aim 2, it is expected that the effects of mPCST-Community will be mediated by increased self-efficacy for pain control and decreased pain catastrophizing. For Aim 3, it is expected that mPCST-Community will demonstrate cost-effectiveness as assessed by all-cause medical resource use, participant and therapist time, and health utilities as well as successful overall accrual, high subject retention, and high intervention adherence. This innovative application proposes the first study to examine the efficacy of mPCST-Community that is designed to address pain in cancer patients in medically underserved areas. While improving access to care is critical, providing efficacious care is just as important. If mPCST- Community is shown to be efficacious, it will provide an intervention that can be rapidly implemented into the care of cancer patients with pain. Importantly, if efficacious this intervention could provide a needed model for non-pharmacological approaches to pain management for other populations of patients with chronic pain.",R01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9886379,R01CA237892,R01CA237892-01A1,237892,A1,,2020,1,88,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
192,2016 Bioanalytical Sensors Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar,"Healthcare is moving from reactive treatment to preventative medicine and this drive is pushing the momentum for new bioanalytical sensing systems. Challenges increase significantly, in progressing bioanalytical sensor technology towards real-world applications; environment, clinical, in vitro and in vivo use. The field of bioanalytical sensors is thus highly relevant to new diagnostics and management of public health; it bridges expertise from biomolecular design and synthetic biology to nanotechnology and materials; from optical physics to electrochemistry etc. It has interfaces with life and medica sciences, drug design, innovative manufacturing. This demands constant and critical attention to new developments, including areas that have not previously contributed to bioanalytical sensors, to initiate and maintain new advances. The 2016 Gordon Research Conference on Bioanalytical Sensors in conjunction with the Gordon Research Seminar will create an intimate environment in which participants with a broad range of knowledge and skills can freely discuss their ideas for analytical systems that provide both molecular data and an overlay of spatio- temporal cartography. In a relaxed, but highly intellectual atmosphere, the rigorous program structure will allow participants to gain inspiration from adjacent fields and discover new opportunities. There are key components to this program: - Presentations (orally and poster) on exceptional new research outcomes, bringing new ideas and technologies to the table. - Proactive discussion sessions catalyzed by the presentations, building an ""innovation collage"" that could impact future development of bioanalytical sensors. - Identifying and highlighting potential impact from fundamental studies of bioanalytical sensor systems and their components to design constraints for their application in real-world settings. - Opportunity and diversity throughout the program, i.e. speakers and participants from academia, government and the private sector, inclusion of women and minorities, international and US researchers. - Giving early career investigators the opportunity to present and discuss. - Catalyzing and fostering cross-disciplinary discussions, and promoting future collaborations. The 2016 GRC and GRS on Bioanalytical Sensors will focus on the ""space between disciplines"" and bridge the gap between the biological and physical expertise to generate ideas and collaborations that will impact future diagnostic platforms from high-technological bioanalytical analyses for fundamental biological discoveries to point-of-care testing in resource-limited countries.",R13,EB,NIBIB,EB,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9124018,R13EB022399,R13EB022399-01,22399,,,2016,1,107,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,

At the heart of this project is a nationally-representative sample of 3,005 community-dwelling adults, from whom extensive interview and biomeasure data were obtained in 2005/6 (W1) when they were ages 57-85. A second wave of data collection in 2010/11 (W2) reinter viewed all surviving participants, their spouses and coresident partners (N=3,377), and established longitudinal, population-based data on health and social life among older Americans.

196,Identifying Optimal Treatment Strategies for Tuberculosis Treatment,"The current standard of care for drug-sensitive TB is a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach, putting hard-to-treat patients at higher risk of relapse and mycobacteria at higher risk of acquiring drug resistance. The Phase 3 treatment-shortening study TBTC/ACTG (Study 31/A5349) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of two new short-course regimens containing high-dose rifapentine. The primary aim of our proposal is to embed full pharmacology and microbiology analyses (PK/PD) in this clinical trial to provide detailed drug pharmacokinetic, MIC response and safety data - including novel data (markers of persisters) for more than 2,000 patients. Our goal is to understand and quantify the interactions among individual drug PK/PD, MICs, new markers of genome load, new markers for persisters, active disease severity and early treatment response in a diverse patient population and recognize how they relate to clinical outcome and safety events. By doing so, we will be able to understand and quantify the contributions of pharmacological (multidrug pharmacokinetic) and non- pharmacological (host, disease severity) components of treatment response and to understand the phenotypes of patients who are hard to treat, allowing us to derive optimal treatment strategies for all patients with drug- sensitive TB, including choice of regimen, treatment duration, and dose. We propose the innovative hypothesis that both the infecting bacteria and the host can be seen as ""low"" and ""high"" risk and that it is the combination of these two risks that together determine treatment outcome and the required duration of treatment, regardless of the drugs used. Our approach will stratify bacterial risk by burden, MIC - even among drug-susceptible Mtb - and the presence of drug-tolerant subpopulations. The host risk will be stratified by disease severity, HIV status and ability to absorb and metabolize drugs (PK). We will then use advanced analytic and modeling strategies to develop tools and algorithms to identify low-risk patients infected with low-risk bacteria who can be treated with ultra-short treatment (<=four months) and high-risk patients infected with high-risk bacteria who will need treatment for longer than six months. Through our analyses, we will be able to select for each patient the regimen that results in the highest likelihood of cure. Our findings will completely change the future of TB clinical trials and care worldwide. This study will address fundamental questions, such as what the exposure-response/safety relationships and favorable AUC/MIC targets are for all first-line TB drugs using a major clinical outcome (relapse) and how early response to treatment relates to clinical outcome in a large and diverse patient population. The project has unprecedented support from the TBTC/ACTG leadership and our industry partner (Sanofi Aventis). The funds in this R01 requests the budget needed to complete drug measures and MIC not included in Study 31 (i.e., all drugs other than rifapentine and moxifloxacin) and the full suite of PK/PD modeling and learnings that go beyond the trial's primary goal of testing the non-inferiority of the experimental four-month regimens.",R01,AI,NIAID,AI,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9740785,R01AI135124,R01AI135124-01A1,135124,A1,,2019,1,109,Audie,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
200,Making the invisible visible: An automated clinical decision support tool for Intimate Partner Violence Risk and Severity Prediction (AIRS),"This project is focused on developing an automated clinical decision support tool for predicting Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) risk and severity based on historical imaging and clinical data. Despite the high prevalence and urgency of this critical public health issue, there is currently no objective tool to diagnose IPV. The challenges in detecting IPV in the health care setting are due to multiple factors, including the patient's feelings of shame and fear of consequences and physician's lack of awareness and fear of offending the patient and partner. While imaging plays an essential role in diagnosing nonaccidental trauma in children because of clear well- established patterns of abuse on imaging studies, a lack of evidence-based research on IPV related imaging patterns has led to under-recognition and underdiagnosis of IPV. By recognizing location and imaging patterns specific to IPV on current and previous radiological studies, radiologists can help identify IPV when the victims are not forthcoming. Our hypothesis is that a multidimensional clinical support tool including imaging and clinical findings harvested from the electronic medical record can provide an accurate and comprehensive calculation of IPV risk. The automated IPV risk and severity predictions can then be integrated to transform the care plan for survivors and make the ""invisible"" visible. Aim 1: To define IPV related imaging patterns and severity by analyzing radiological studies of known IPV survivors and matched controls Aim 2: To determine IPV risk and severity prediction by developing a clinical decision support tool derived from historical imaging and clinical predictors. Aim 3: To validate the IPV prediction model on new datasets and evaluate the integration of results in radiology workflow using a safe repository. If our hypotheses are correct, established IPV related imaging patterns, a CDS tool derived from historical imaging and clinical predictors integrated into clinical care will be able to diagnose IPV objectively.",R01,EB,NIBIB,OD;EB,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10522589,R01EB032384,R01EB032384-01A1,32384,A1,,2022,1,111,Pablo,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
214,The Use of Telemedicine in the Care of Nursing Home Residents with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The Use of Telemedicine in the Care of Nursing Home Residents with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic PROJECT SUMMARY The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has devastated nursing home residents in the US, nearly half of whom are diagnosed with Alzheimer's and other related dementias (ADRD). To limit resident exposure and expand safe access to desperately-needed care from physicians and advanced practice providers, Medicare dropped previously tight restrictions and temporarily allowed SNFs to broadly use telemedicine to obtain care for residents. Dropping these restrictions helped facilitate a rapid adoption of telemedicine in SNFs, from <1% of SNFs billing for any telemedicine services in Oct-Dec 2019 to 55% in Apr- May 2020. Telemedicine has long been regarded as a promising, but underused, delivery innovation for SNFs addressing two major gaps in care. First, SNF clinicians are not always onsite, so medical issues that present during off-hours are often addressed by transferring patients, often unnecessarily, to the emergency department. Second, due to both financial and logistic reasons it is very difficult for SNF residents to obtain specialty care, including specialties critical those with ADRD like neurology or psychiatry. A limited literature suggests that telemedicine can bridge both of these care gaps, but more rigorous evidence is needed. In 2021, understanding the adoption and clinical impact of SNF telemedicine for the vulnerable population of older adults with ADRD has new urgency. We propose to use Medicare claims, the Minimum Data Set and a national survey on SNF telemedicine implementation to answer the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the patient-level association of SNF adoption of telemedicine in 2020 with health care use and clinical outcomes (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) for SNF residents with and without ADRD. 2) Use group-based trajectory models to characterize 2020-2021 SNF-level patterns of telemedicine use (e.g., sustaining vs. de-adopting) and SNF characteristics associated with different trajectories. 3) Survey a national sample of SNFs, stratified by their trajectories measured in Aim 2, to assess facility leadership perceptions of telemedicine use and telemedicine implementation strategies. Understanding how SNFs have used telemedicine and its association with clinical outcomes is essential to inform how Medicare and state Medicaid programs should regulate and promote telemedicine use in SNFs. Our findings will also help guide clinicians who care for SNF residents with ADRD on the clinical impact associated with telemedicine use and how it is being used nationally.",R01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10345587,R01AG075507,R01AG075507-01,75507,,,2022,1,118,Leonie,,,,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
220,Reducing Alcohol use among Elective Surgical Patients using Adaptive Interventions,"Surgery is a pivotal life event during which the acuity and imminence of surgical risk can motivate patients to make major changes to behaviors and lifestyle factors to optimize surgical health. Preoperative alcohol consumption (>2 drinks a day) is a common surgical risk factor linked to increased postoperative complications. Appropriately timed interventions could promote short- and long-term alcohol use reduction and prevent excess surgical morbidity and mortality. However, the dearth of research in this area limits our ability to intervene effectively or leverage motivation at critical time points. This study uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) to test the efficacy of adaptive interventions for elective surgical patients reporting high-risk alcohol use. These adaptive interventions use decision rules at critical points during the surgical episode of care to modify treatment type and intensity based on early treatment response. The specific aims are: 1) Test the efficacy of adaptive interventions that begin with preoperative 'Virtual Coaching' relative to Enhanced Usual Care on reducing alcohol use, surgical complications, and hospital length of stay; and 2) Identify the most efficacious second-stage intervention to sustained alcohol use reduction after surgery among early treatment responders and non-responders. Elective surgical patients (N = 440) will be randomized before surgery to either Virtual Coaching or Enhanced Usual Care. Initial treatment response will be assessed at the 2-month follow up for the perioperative period. Early responders (i.e., abstinence or low-risk alcohol use) will be re-randomized to postoperative strategies, either continued Virtual Coaching or stepped down to Usual Care. Early non-responders (i.e., not abstinent or low risk drinking), will be re-randomized to alternative postoperative strategies, either 'On-track,' a mobile health intervention that incorporates self- monitoring and progress feedback, or a combined intervention (Virtual Coaching + On-Track). Outcomes will be measured at 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups and via electronic health records. Secondary aims are: 1) Identify the best performing adaptive interventions; and 2) Identify baseline and time varying moderators of intervention efficacy. Results of this study will have wide-ranging implications for innovating and moving beyond static alcohol interventions in healthcare settings and will advance surgical health optimization research. This study is consistent with the priorities of the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism which seeks to advance addiction health services by integrating alcohol treatment into mainstream healthcare, thereby improving access and decreasing stigma. The adaptive interventions developed in this study enables real-time treatment tailoring based on individual's response to first stage interventions, a critical advance in care consistent with national precision health priorities which seek to tailor treatment to individual needs.",R01,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10337940,R01AA029666,R01AA029666-01,29666,,,2022,1,121,Pablo,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
225,Testing pathways linking sleep quality to self-injurious thoughts and behaviors,"Sleep disturbance is a robust precursor to subsequent self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs), including suicide completion. Yet, to date, few studies have been conducted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this association. However, improved understanding of this phenomenon could allow for better ability to predict and intervene on SITBs risk, which fluctuates on a daily basis due to the presence of acute stressors (e.g., one or several nights of poor sleep). Growing evidence indicates a strong relationship between nightly sleep quality (SQ) and next day self-regulatory capacity. Specifically, poor SQ is associated with next day depleted self-regulatory capacity, such that individuals are more emotionally reactive to negative stimuli and are less able to modulate their emotional responses. Negative affect in particular is associated with frequency and intensity of SITBs, especially in individuals who are at higher baseline risk for SITBs. Thus, we propose that self-regulatory capacity may be one mechanism underlying the link between nightly SQ and daily SITBs, and that this relationship is particularly pronounced among high-risk individuals. The goals of this research are to test this hypothesis in a pair of studies using a variety of methods. In the first study, we will use daily experience methods to establish within-subject associations between nightly SQ and daily SITB among high- risk adults (i.e., chronically suicidal adults in an intensive outpatient program), and test negative affect as a mediator for these associations (Aim 1). In the second study, we will directly examine self-regulatory capacity in a controlled context using laboratory methods. Specifically, we will measure the extent that prior SQ (sleep actigraphy, averaged over 3 days) contributes to negative affect in response to a laboratory stressor in both low- and high-risk adults. Further, we will examine self-regulatory capacity (i.e., resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia) as a mediator for this association, and test whether these associations are strongest among those with higher baseline risk for SITBs (Aim 2). Ultimately, findings obtained from this project could lay the groundwork for future research to establish precise clinical indicators and biomarkers for SITBs risk associated with sleep disturbance. Importantly, the goals of the proposed research will be accomplished as part of a tailored research training plan focused on developing expertise in SITBs and psychopathology, sleep, important and cutting edge research methods (e.g., psychophysiology, sleep actigraphy, etc.), and advanced statistical approaches. The proposed plan would also include advanced coursework, close supervision and guidance from experts in the field, scientific writing and presentation experience, and opportunities for advanced clinical training with high-risk individuals and sleep disordered populations.",F31,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,6,1,No,Awarded,9193920,F31MH108349,F31MH108349-01A1,108349,A1,,2016,1,113,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
230,Randomized trial of a leadership and organizational change strategy to improve the implementation and sustainment of digital measurement-based care in youth mental health services,"Psychiatric disorders are the leading cause of mortality and disability among youth in high income countries, accounting for 21% of total disease burden, and afflicting 1 in 10 youths in the US with severe impairment. Over 1,200 effective interventions, or evidence-based practices (EBPs), have been shown to improve the well-being of youth with psychiatric disorders. However, despite these advances, less than half of youths treated in community settings experience symptom improvement, a situation largely attributed to the low rates at which community providers adopt EBPs and, even when adopted, the low fidelity with which EBPs are implemented and sustained. Digital measurement-based care (MBC) systems, which collect treatment outcome data from patients and provide clinicians with real-time feedback and recommendations based on 'big data' actuarial algorithms, are a high-impact digital health technology EBP shown in 29 RCTs to generate improvements in clinical outcomes (i.e., d=.3-.5) across patient ages, diagnoses, and treatment modalities. Despite this, digital MBC systems are rarely used in community settings for youth, and when they are, fidelity and sustainment are often poor. Recent reviews indicate that many of these implementation and sustainment deficits can be traced to a lack of organization-level 'social infrastructure' or social contexts and leadership that do not support and motivate clinicians to adopt and use MBC systems; without this organizational social infrastructure, many implementation efforts fail. These observations are consistent with organizational climate theory and theories of behavior change which we have integrated to generate our primary hypothesis: achieving effective implementation and sustainment of MBC in community settings requires mechanisms of a strong organizational implementation climate and high clinician motivation generated through effective clinic leadership. With NIH support, we have pilot tested a highly transportable implementation strategy called Leadership and Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) that targets these mechanisms. Preliminary studies in mental health clinics show that LOCI is feasible, acceptable, and improves implementation leadership and climate. We propose a randomized controlled trial of LOCI in 20 children's mental health clinics, incorporating 120 clinicians and a total of 720 youth outpatients, to test LOCI's effects relative to implementation as usual (IAU) on clinician fidelity and youth clinical outcomes of a well-established digital MBC intervention during two phases of initial implementation and sustainment. This project brings together an early career/new investigator (Williams) collaborating with experienced, NIH funded implementation scientists (Aarons, Ehrhart) to advance programmatic research on the leadership, organizational, and clinician mechanisms that improve digital MBC implementation and sustainment. The study will (1) test LOCI's effects on clinician fidelity to MBC and youth clinical outcomes during initial implementation, and (2) sustainment; and (3) test the multilevel mechanisms that link LOCI to MBC fidelity.",R01,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9713959,R01MH119127,R01MH119127-01,119127,,,2019,1,126,Audie,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
248,A Multimodal Brain-Gut Physiological Descriptive Method for Migraine,"Migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by debilitating headaches. It affects 6% of men and 18% of women and costs $36B annually in direct and indirect costs in the US alone. Many of the commonly-occurring symptoms of migraine point to some form of autonomic dysfunction, supported by brain imaging studies. However, it remains unclear specifically how migraine influences autonomic dysfunction. Previous studies that have aimed to quantify autonomic dysfunction have had conflicting results, likely due to varying methodology and limited monitoring time period. Additional support for the role of autonomic dysfunction in migraine comes from the fact that over 90% of migraineurs experience problems with gut motility that can be linked to gastroparesis, or delayed gastric emptying. Recent advances in wearable technologies, technology miniaturization, and high-resolution multimodal recording have opened new doors to detailed studies of the interactions between the brain, gastric motility, and pain using at-home monitoring. This project seeks to build a unified model of brain-gut dysfunction in migraineurs using at-home multimodal monitoring. By applying sophisticated signal processing and statistical modeling methods to perform causal inference, the proposed work will characterize patterns of dysfunction between the brain, autonomic nervous system, and gut motility in migraineurs compared to healthy controls. Aim 1 of the project will first characterize in detail the relationship between autonomics and gut motility in healthy controls and patients with gastroparesis not linked to migraine using an existing dataset. Then in Aim 2, new data will be collected from healthy controls and migraineurs both in the clinic and at home, and dynamics and patterns of brain-gut information flow will be characterized. Subject-provided descriptions of migraine from the electronic health record will be compared to objective physiological readouts. The results of this project have the potential to transform the understanding of migraine pathophysiology, pave a path towards personalized therapeutic strategies for migraine, and lay the foundation for advance prediction of migraine, which can drastically reduce its economic burden. Furthermore, this project will provide objective physiologic insight into a patient experience of pain that is often ignored or mischaracterized because it cannot be tied to an identifiable pathology. The proposed project will take place at Stanford University, between the Department of Bioengineering, Wu Tsai Neuroscience Institute, School of Medicine, and Stanford Pain Management Center. The project will be co- mentored by Dr. Todd Coleman, a bioengineer and statistician specializing in neuroscience and gut motility, and Dr. Sean Mackey, a world-renowned chronic pain specialist. Dr. Meredith Barad and Dr. Linda Nguyen will be consultants.

Her long term goal is to become a leading nurse scientist in designing, implementing, and evaluating technology supported behavioral interventions targeted for improved disease self-management (i.e. medication adherence, retention in care) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected, ethnic minority adolescents and young adults. With an extensive background in pediatric HIV nursing and completed NIH funded pre and post-doctoral interdisciplinary research traineeships, the candidate has begun to develop the knowledge-base and skills necessary for this goal. This award details a 3-year scope of mentored career development through which she will gain the foundation for future research endeavors. Specifically, the goals of this proposal are to: 1) conduct a novel research project under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary team of expert researchers; 2) acquire expertise in health informatics for implementation of technology supported behavioral interventions, health disparities, and advanced qualitative and mixed methods design and analysis through firsthand experience, didactic interactions with mentors, and graduate level coursework; 3) build a network of colleagues and collaborators within New York University and elsewhere through this research and participation at national and international meetings; and 4) prepare and submit a federal research grant (R-21) based upon the skills and findings from this award period.

292,Effectiveness and adoption of a Smart home-based social assistive robot for care of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease,"It is highly beneficial and meaningful for individuals with Alzheimer's disease (IAD) to age-in-place. Prolonging time at home helps preserve their memories, spatial awareness and socio-emotional connections. At the same time, undue care burden is imposed and is associated with high rates of depression and anxiety among family caregivers. While relocation to long term care is an option, the alarming increase in annual costs with assisted living and nursing home admission creates significant financial constraints on the families. There is a significant need for novel technological solutions to promote independence, health, and safety of IAD to age-in-place. To address this need, we propose to develop a smart home-based social assistive robot (SAR) called Mobile Assistive Robot with Smart Sensing (MARSS). Our innovative SAR will: a) have four evidence-supported modalities of care built in- activity engagement and assistance, telehealth, home safety, and caregiver-care recipient connectivity; and b) a training program to enable a non-technology expert (caregiver, family member or health professional) to scale and program the modalities to fit with the disease severity and context of the IAD. MARSS will be developed and tested in accordance to the NIH Stage Model of Intervention Development. We have already pilot-tested a lab-based model of MARSS (Stage Ia). Now our priority is to pilot test the technology in the community (with 8 dyads of IAD and caregivers) and verify its implementation fidelity, robustness as well as behavior change techniques to optimize target engagement of IADs and caregivers (Aim I- Stage IB). To address Aim II (Stage III), we will conduct an 18-month randomized controlled trial to validate the real-world efficacy of MARSS. We will recruit 60 dyads in two staggered cohorts of IAD and caregivers and randomly assign them to the intervention (n=30) or a control group (n=30). We will gather repeated measures data on the IAD's functional independence, safety, and physical and cognitive health, and the caregiver's perceived care burden, autonomy and wellbeing over nine data points, 2 months apart. To account mechanism-focused change, we will objectively collect data on the technology's utilization to tease out the influence of the MARSS's modalities on the intervention outcomes. In addition to much needed empirical evidence on AD-based SARs, the findings will contribute knowledge to create and test advanced yet pragmatic technological solutions to strengthen aging-in-place of IAD.",R01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10525655,R01AG075892,R01AG075892-01A1,75892,A1,,2022,1,158,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
296,"An interactive, narrative intervention to address the mental health treatment gap among young people living with HIV in Nigeria","Young people living with HIV (Y-PLWH) have poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy and engagement in HIV care, making HIV the leading cause of death for African adolescents. Depression and psychological distress are much more common among Y-PLWH than in the general population, and are associated with significantly worse adherence to care and treatment when compared to Y-PLWH without these co-morbid conditions. Thus, untreated depression and severe psychological distress are important contributors to poor HIV outcomes in this population. Nigeria is home to the 4th largest HIV population globally and 10% of Y-PLWH, but mental health screening is not routinely conducted in this setting, and less than 10% of those diagnosed have access to evidence-based care. Despite this treatment gap, few interventions have targeted the mental health needs of Y-PLWH in Africa. The World Health Organization recommends that caregivers of Y-PLWH adopt youth- friendly strategies and incorporate psychosocial services to meet their needs, and that task shifting to non- specialized health workers be used to overcome the dearth of trained professionals in low and middle-income countries. Task-shifted problem Solving Therapy (PST) has been effectively used by our team and others to treat both depression and psychological distress using a task-shifted approach. However, PST is an intensive strategy (typically 6-15 weekly sessions) often delivered in-person and poor completion rates are associated with less effectiveness -- a concern further magnified during the current COVID-19 climate. Mobile health technologies may be uniquely suited to surmount some of the obstacles for effective PST delivery in Nigeria and novel digital game-based strategies, can be utilized to promote engagement in mental health interventions on a platform that is compelling for young people. Our team has developed, a preliminary prototype of a theory-grounded game, Change My Story, in which players navigate difficult experiences based on drivers of psychological distress and interact with a virtual environment to choose a narrative path toward the story's conclusion. In this proposal, we will finalize the prototype of Change My Story, and integrate this game into a comprehensive, task-shifted PST intervention delivered via mobile phone to optimize engagement in mental health care. Through the R21 mechanism, we aim to: 1) finalize the Change My Story prototype to address key drivers of psychological distress among Y-PLWH in Nigeria and 2) establish the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of Change My Story among Y-PLWH with psychological distress in Nigeria. Through the R33 mechanism, we aim to 1) conduct a hybrid implementation-effectiveness pilot RCT for 80 Y-PLWH with depression or psychological distress, and compare feasibility, acceptability, engagement, satisfaction and preliminary effectiveness among individuals receiving PST alone or PST with Change My Story, and 2) use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to assess factors influencing engagement, acceptability, and satisfaction along with facilitators and barriers to implementation delivery.",R21,HD,NICHD,TW;HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10311346,R21HD106578,R21HD106578-01,106578,,,2021,1,160,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
307,Improving asthma control using Internet-based cognitive-behavioral treatment for insomnia,"Asthma is a prevalent, chronic inflammatory disease of the airways associated with a range of adverse health outcomes. Sleep difficulties are often viewed as a consequence of nocturnal awakenings due to nighttime asthma symptoms, which will resolve with appropriate treatment of asthma symptoms. However, insomnia symptoms occur even in those asthmatics without asthma-related nocturnal awakenings, thus representing comorbid insomnia. Our prior work suggests that insomnia can negatively impact asthma control by further limiting engagement in activities and quality of life and increasing the risk for future asthma exacerbations and need for emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Our proposed study adopts a novel perspective on the interaction between insomnia and asthma control: targeted treatments for insomnia could improve asthma control and reduce the burden of disease. We propose to test the efficacy of a Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia (CBT-I) intervention on sleep and asthma control in adults. We will compare two randomized interventions: (1) a self-guided, real-world applicable, Internet version of CBT-I, Sleep Healthy Using The Internet (SHUTi), and (2) an enhanced usual care (EUC), involving an educational video on insomnia. The aims of this proposed study are: (1) to compare the efficacy of SHUTi vs. EUC on sleep outcomes at 3 and 6 months after initiation of treatment in adults with asthma and comorbid insomnia, (2) to compare the efficacy of SHUTi vs. EUC on changes in asthma control from baseline to 3 and 6 months, and (3) to determine whether changes in sleep mediate the effects of treatment on asthma control at 3 and 6 months. Our exploratory aim is to determine whether changes in biomarkers of airway inflammation across 3- and 6-month follow-up account for the relationship between changes in sleep (from baseline to 3 months) and improvements in asthma control. The use of an efficacious, low cost, Internet-based, cognitive-behavioral intervention for insomnia can provide a treatment option that could be delivered in real-world clinical settings. Findings from our study could encourage the inclusion of insomnia-as a comorbid condition that affects asthma control, and should be identified and treated-into the current guidelines for the proper management of asthma.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9380637,R01HL131587,R01HL131587-01A1,131587,A1,,2017,1,154,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
324,An Implantable Wireless System to Study Gastric Neurophysiology,"Gastric contractions are initiated and coordinated by an underlying bioelectrical activity termed slow waves (SWs). Aberrant SW patterns (dysrhythmias) have been associated with gastric dysmotility in several significant gastric disorders, notably gastroparesis (GP) and functional dyspepsia. There are also well- documented associations between GP and damage to the vagus nerve that are common in people with diabetes. Gastric pacing and vagus nerve stimulation have been proposed as treatment modalities for gastric dysrhythmia. However, the pathophysiological roles of electrical dysrhythmias and neural mechanisms in gastric motility disorders, and the role and therapeutic potential of the vagus and gastric electrical stimulation remain weakly defined. This is mainly due to the lack of technologies that can reveal the mechanisms of action. Electroneurogram (ENG) signals obtained through cuff electrodes from the peripheral nerves have been shown to provide valuable information regarding operation of afferent and efferent nerves. Compared to microelectrodes, cuff electrodes are minimally invasive and provide stable recordings long-term. These signals have been used to study neuromuscular, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The ENG signal is most informative when it can be associated with the function of the end organ. When studying conscious freely-behaving subjects, this requires implantable devices that can simultaneously acquire ENG and associated organ functions. To fully understand the underlying mechanisms of action of gastric pacing and neuromodulation therapies for functional motility disorders, a tool that can map and monitor-in high resolution-the coordinated activity of gastric SWs and ENG signals from peripheral nerves such as vagal branches innervating the stomach in real time would be invaluable. Gastric SWs directly recorded from the stomach serosa provide the only reliable and descriptive source of data on spatial dysrhythmic patterns. However, a key limitation is that wires traverse the abdominal wall or a natural orifice, posing risks of discomfort, dislodgement, or infection. We propose to develop and validate, in a porcine model, a Wireless Implantable Neuro- Gastroenterology System (WINGS) that can simultaneously acquire SWs and compound action potentials from the gastric peripheral nerves and map these signals in high resolution. The system consists of an implantable system-on-chip to condition and wirelessly transmit the signals, a wearable unit to wirelessly recharge the implant and relay the signals, and a receiver connected to a computer to display, store, and process the data. With its dual capability to monitor ENGs and SWs, WINGS can be implanted laparoscopically or endoscopically via a single minimally invasive procedure. Because the two types of signals will be acquired by one device, their precise timing will be known, and no synchronization will be required.",U18,EB,NIBIB,OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9054538,U18EB021789,U18EB021789-01,21789,,,2015,1,175,Audie,,,,,,,,,
332,Rural Disparities in Pediatric Obesity: The iAmHealthy Intervention,"Research indicates that pediatric obesity prevalence is high among all children, but that children from rural areas are disproportionately affected. There are very few interventions specifically targeting pediatric obesity treatment among rural children, a factor that contributes to this health disparity. Previous research from our lab indicates that mHealth is feasible and acceptable for the delivery of pediatric obesity interventions to rural children as this type of intervention lowers child Body Mass Index z score (BMIz) and helps children and families to significantly change their health behaviors. The current application extends this work in a new and innovative direction by moving the mHealth intervention into rural family homes, increasing convenience and dose simultaneously. The intervention is composed of both group and individual family level components, based upon new research that indicates this combination is highly effective. Finally, the composition of the intervention groups is also innovative as they will be composed of children from the same school, making individual level factors as well as factors clustered at the school level addressable in one intervention. The current study proposes to compare the effectiveness of two active interventions: iAmHealthy vs. control (a newsletter control group) using in cluster-randomized design. iAmHealthy is a 32 week behavioral intervention focused on nutrition, behavior and physical activity that engages parents and children in treatment using mHealth technology. It combines family based behavioral groups with individual level child and family support - all provided directly to homes via mHealth technologies. Children and families meeting inclusion criteria from a total of 18 schools will be randomly assigned by school to condition, with at least 8 families participating at each rural school, for a total of 144 child and 144 adult participants. We hypothesize that: the iAmHealthy intervention will result in significantly greater improvement in food choices than the active control intervention (as indicated by servings of sugar sweetened beverages, number of servings of ""red foods,"" and number of servings of fruits and vegetables); the iAmHealthy intervention will result in significantly greater improvement in levels of physical activity than the control intervention (as indicated by change in number of minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity); and, that the iAmHealthy intervention will result in significantly greater improvement in child BMIz and parent BMI than the control intervention. Aim 2 uses the RE-AIM framework to measure the effectiveness of iAmHealthy. iAmHealthy is an easily scalable, widely disseminable pediatric obesity intervention option for rural children and families, if found to be effective; the results of the current study could significantly alter the way we treat pediatric obesity among high risk and underserved rural children.",R01,NR,NINR,NR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9238065,R01NR016255,R01NR016255-01A1,16255,A1,,2017,1,179,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
347,The role of fathers' sleep quality and white matter microstructure on the adjustment to parenthood,"The transition to parenthood is a period of profound transformation and often vulnerability in new parents. Though most of the research on this transition has focused on mothers, new fathers must also adapt to parenthood. Many parents experience sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality, which may increase mental health risks of new parents and reduce the quality of caregiving behavior. Prior work in non-parent samples suggests that sleep quality may be linked to the structural connectivity of the brain, as measured within white matter microstructure (WMM). Less efficient connectivity of WMM has also been associated with mental health problems. This project will examine postpartum sleep quality in first-time fathers and test associations with their postpartum mental health and WMM. The project also examines postpartum WMM as a mediator between sleep quality and mental health symptoms during the transition to parenthood. This project draws from an existing longitudinal study of first-time parents followed from the prenatal to postpartum periods that incorporated neuroimaging. Study aims are to: (1) Examine how postpartum sleep quality, controlling for prenatal sleep quality, affects psychological adjustment to parenthood in new fathers; (2) Investigate whether sleep quality is associated with postpartum white matter microstructure (WMM) among first-time fathers; (3) Examine the mediating role of postpartum WMM on the relationship between postpartum sleep quality and fathers' adjustment to parenthood. Study findings can provide insight into the role of sleep on the paternal brain and mental health and inform interventions facilitating the adjustment to parenthood.

348,High-Performance Compute Cluster for Comprehensive Cancer and Infectious Diseases Research,"Fred Hutch respectfully requests funds to upgrade the current 523-node, 3328-core high performance computing (HPC) cluster, which was created in 2004 and expanded in 2006, 2010 (S10 funds), 2013, 2015 (S10 funds), and 2018. 456 end of life nodes (1824 cores) will be replaced and 144 nodes (3456 cores) will be added, creating a new 211-node, 4996-core system with an overall 50% increase in core count, 60% increase in processing power, and more than 100% increase in memory capacity over the old system. The expanded capacity will enable deep and efficient analysis of our research studies and accommodate 20% annual growth in computing intensive research, much of which is not possible on the current cluster. The core user group for the new HPC cluster consists of at least 37 NIH-funded research groups participating in this proposal, however as much as 85 groups use the cluster regularly. Their biomedical research is aimed at eradicating cancer and other diseases and dependent on computationally intensive technical approaches such as development of novel statistical analysis or machine learning methods, for example for assessing immune correlates to facilitate vaccine development, analyzing large scale clinical trials or to develop software tools for the analysis of large-scale immunological datasets, DNA and RNA sequencing, modeling prostate cancer outcomes, studies of the human microbiome, modeling of cancers, mRNA, miRNA, and structural variant detection, structural biology with Cryo- EM, modeling of infectious agents and pandemics, computational modeling, prediction and design of macromolecular structures and interactions, identifying drivers of neoplasia and an international consortium improving colorectal cancer detection using GWAS, whole genome sequencing and genome-wide gene- environment (GxE) studies as well as research in diabetes, mhealth and cardiovascular diseases. Several of the Major Users at Fred Hutch are currently experiencing substantial delays in accomplishing their work using the current cluster. Others have projects that cannot be done at all on the existing instrument. (see Research Projects section for details). The Scientific Computing department (SciComp) has operated the current HPC cluster for more than 10 years and has a staff with a combined experience of over 150 years. The proposed new HPC cluster will be installed in available space in a Fred Hutch datacenter. The expanded cluster will address both immediate and future needs of our user community, supporting NIH-funded research at Fred Hutch. Funded research at our Center will greatly benefit from the increased data-processing capacity and improved performance of the requested HPC cluster, including applications of machine learning to the study of clinical trial efficacy, comparison of immune system receptors to identify responses to specific pathogens/diseases, modeling of carcinogenesis.

350,Intensive longitudinal study of suicidal behaviors and related health outcomes,"Many leading causes of death have declined significantly over the past 100 years (e.g., tuberculosis, pneumonia/influenza, gastritis);; however, the suicide rate is virtually identical to what it was 100 years ago. Lack of progress in the prevention of suicide is due in large part to the limited understanding of this problem. Suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs), like other behavior problems (e.g., alcohol use, substance use, eating disorders), rarely occur in the research lab where they can be carefully probed and cannot be ethically induced in the lab. As a result, experts lack a firm understanding of the fundamental properties of STBs, and of how, why, and when they unfold in nature. The purpose of this study is to address this enormous gap by using newly developed smartphone and wearable biosensor technologies to conduct an intensive longitudinal study that will advance the understanding and prediction of STBs and related behaviors. This study will monitor 600 people (300 adults and 300 adolescents) at elevated risk of STBs (i.e., those presenting to a psychiatric hospital with suicide ideation and/or a recent suicide attempt) during a high risk time period (i.e., post--hospitalization). The first aim of this study is to identify digital phenotypes of STBs using data collected both actively/subjectively using repeated smartphone surveys and passively/objectively using continuous data from smartphones (e.g., GPS, accelerometer, communications data) and wearable biosensors (e.g., electrodermal activity, accelerometer). The second aim is to map the dynamic trajectories of STBs over time. The third aim is to identify short--term predictors of STBs during the 6 months post-- hospital discharge. Ongoing research by the proposed team demonstrates the feasibility of: recruiting and retaining the proposed samples, intensively monitoring them over time using digital devices, and using analyses of these rich data streams to make discoveries about how STBs and related behaviors unfold in nature. The data collected in this study will provide a rich data source that will be used by our research team and collaborative researchers to advance the understanding, prediction, and ultimate prevention of STBs and related outcomes.",U01,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9577581,U01MH116928,U01MH116928-01,116928,,,2018,1,189,Audie,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
370,"Project BrEAtHe (Brothers, Reclaiming, Emotional, Awareness, Tranquility, Healing & Ex-istence): Disrupting Racism-related Stress, Trauma, & Problematic Substance Use in Young Adult Black Men","COVID-19 and upticks in U.S. racialized violence are stealing our collective breaths and brewing a potent mix, or syndemic of stress, trauma, and negative affect - key risk factors for behavioral health disparities. Behavioral health disparities among Black males are well-documented and known to erupt during young adulthood (ages 18-29) when this population exhibits steep escalations in problematic substance use (e.g., marijuana and alcohol). Many young adult Black males also reside in disadvantaged neighborhoods settings with conditions like high violence, alcohol, and other drug activity linked to substance use. While we know that Black males residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods are disproportionately impacted by racism (i.e., racial profiling by police and citizens) and that racism is a risk for self-medicating with alcohol and marijuana, few substance use interventions have been adapted to target this culturally-relevant stressor or related trauma symptoms. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) interventions featuring meditation and breathing space training have been shown to reduce maladaptive stress response, trauma symptoms, and substance use, principally by improving self-regulation (i.e., affect and physiological). Yet, a fundamental lag exists in the cultural adaptation of established MBSR interventions and exploration of new modalities for delivering them to Black males. As a result, less is known about their feasibility, acceptability, or probable effectiveness in this disparity population. Successful MBSR interventions require participant home practice and deployment of acquired skills in real-world settings. Integrating mobile technologies, especially ones providing 'real-time' feedback, could further enhance MBSR interventions' impacts on substance use mitigation among young adult Black males by providing supportive nudges in moments and settings when racism-related stress and trauma symptoms likely peak. Adapted, mobile technology-assisted MBSR interventions will likely be more acceptable by young adult Black males when they are developed with their input and address culturally relevant stress, trauma, and the gender norms (e.g., boys don't cry) often encouraging males to regulate negative affect by pushing it out of conscious awareness. Our theory-driven central hypothesis, is that preventive interventions aimed at modulating racism-related stress response, trauma symptoms, and affect regulation especially in 'real-time' will reduce problematic substance use progression among young adult Black males. This R34 application proposes the following aims to be carried out among 18-29 year-old Black males in Durham, NC and Hartford, CT - settings with strikingly similar neighborhood disadvantage: 1) To culturally adapt a validated instructor-led, group-based and mobile technology-assisted, MBSR intervention; 2) To pilot test and assess the feasibility/acceptability of a culturally adapted instructor-led, group-based and mobile technology-assisted, MBSR intervention; 3) To identify preliminary effect sizes and mediators to determine sample size and power for a larger fully scaled mobile technology-assisted, instructor-led, group-based MBSR intervention.",R34,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10288430,R34DA054412,R34DA054412-01,54412,,,2021,1,200,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
390,A Proposal to Establish the Mississippi Violence Injury Prevention (VIP) Program,"The University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC), in partnership with four well-established community groups-People's Advocacy Institute, Strong Arms of JXN, Operation Good, and the Mississippi Public Health Institute-propose to participate in the Community Level Interventions for Firearm and Related Violence, Injury and Mortality Prevention (CLIF-VP) Research Network by establishing the Mississippi Violence Injury Prevention (VIP) Program. Together, individual team members represent community activists and several academic disciplines, including emergency medicine, psychology, public health, survey research, GIS and remote sensing, law, and nursing. Mississippi had the nation's highest firearm mortality rate in 2020 at 28.6 per 100,000 residents. Jackson, the state's capital, had a 2021 homicide rate of 97.6 per 100,000 residents, more than three times higher than the state and 15 times higher than the national rate of 6.5 murders per 100,000 residents. UMMC, which is the only Level 1 Trauma Center in the state, administered care to 1,129 patients presenting with injuries from firearms or related violence. As part of the CLIF-VP Research Network, the Mississippi VIP Program will work closely with its Coordinating Center, the other Research Projects funded through this Agreement, the CLIF-VP Research Network's Stakeholder Board(s), Steering Committee, and workgroups to successfully carry out cross-project activities. The Mississippi VIP Program's research design includes a two-year planning (UG3) phase and a three- year implementation (UH3) phase. Two specific aims have been identified for the UG3 phase: (1) define and create the machinery to longitudinally monitor the community-level social determinants of firearm injury in the greater Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan area with respect to (a) perceived needs, (b) available resources and their utilization, and (c) opportunities for capacity building; and (2) identify principal community-specific risk elements for (a) firearm injury, (b) suboptimal functional recovery, and (c) retaliation and reinjury, and collaboratively develop linked community- and hospital-based protective resources to address these risks. Two specific aims have been identified for the UH3 phase: (1) conduct a clinical trial that implements optimized community-focused interventions during the UG3 phase using a step-wedge cluster approach, and measures longitudinal community and individual impact of violence prevention interventions on (a) incidence of firearm injury, (b) functional victim recovery, (c) incidence of retaliation and reinjury, and (d) economic impact; and (2) coordinate ongoing community, regional, and telehealth expansion and adoption of optimized community-focused resources in concert with the CLIF-VP Research Network.",UG3,MD,NIMHD,OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10613061,UG3MD018298,UG3MD018298-01,18298,,,2022,1,210,Audie,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
410,A mobile framework to measure ejection fraction by automated non-invasive analysis of cardiac signals,"This SBIR Phase II project will develop a novel mobile framework to measure left ventricular ejection fraction as a marker for systolic dysfunction using automated non-invasive analysis of cardiac signals. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women accounting for more than one-third (33.6%) of all U.S. deaths. In 2011, total costs associated with cardiovascular disease in the U.S. were estimated to be $320 billion, making it the costliest health problem facing the nation. In addition, it occurs disproportionately among minority and health disparity populations. For example, heart failure related deaths are 37% higher among African- Americans than among whites. Decreased ejection fraction is a marker of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, the most common type of heart failure. Overall cardiac health can be significantly improved by proper triage at the primary care level by determination of the ejection fraction without requiring a 2-D echo-cardiogram. It will provide health care professionals with point-of-care technology to guide diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic efforts. Portable device capability makes it even more accessible and readily available without high costs. As the technology being developed does not require skilled operators or specially trained physicians, it will allow healthcare providers to measure ejection fraction within their normal medical training. Through the course of the two-year Phase I work we have developed a revolutionary medical device that enables measurement of ejection fraction using the cardiac sound signals measured at the chest wall. The scope of the science proposed in this Phase II project is to complete development of the diagnostic framework using our specially engineered sensor system combined with the novel algorithm technology to be accessed via a smartphone or tablet for a portable and cost-effective solution. Resource-poor communities across the globe lack access to quality healthcare arising from shortages in medical expertise and poor availability of expensive medical diagnostic devices. In recent years, mobile phones have become increasingly advanced and ubiquitous. The mobile framework developed through this project is a tremendous opportunity to provide low-cost diagnostics to under-served populations. The benefit of this pioneering work is the development of a low-cost and portable solution that can be used to diagnose systolic dysfunction, and thus enable improved screening during routine annual checkups, doctor visits, at community medical screenings, classes, and health fairs leading to healthier communities. It will make measuring ejection fraction as routine as measuring blood pressure. In Phase II, we will continue validation of the device through user-trials and seek FDA 510(k) clearance for commercialization.

416,Actigraphy Enhanced Clinical Chronic Lower Back Pain Management,"Effective management of patients with chronic low back pain requires accurate and reliable methods to measure the effects of treatment on both pain and function. Yet this presents a serious dilemma to clinicians, who must currently rely exclusively on retrospective self-report measures (e.g., questionnaires) to capture this information. These assessments are usually only completed each time the patient returns to the clinic, thus placing an over-reliance on patients' memories and potentially missing critical inflection points in symptom or functional trajectories. The combination of potentially biased and unreliable reporting makes this method of assessment far from optimal. We recently completed the NIH I-Corps program that revealed pain specialists are in urgent need of objective data on patient functioning to guide treatment decisions. The physicians we interviewed indicated that quantitative assessment of activity levels, or actigraphy, may provide a solution because it is a validated clinical research tool for assessing pain-related disability/function and response to treatment. The hurdles faced by existing commercial and research devices, however, have prevented the implementation of actigraphy for routine clinical care due to the technological burden for patients and clinicians (e.g., device charging, Bluetooth/Wi-Fi pairing, required apps, syncing, analysis software), cost, and the lack of standardization in device quality and data output. Therefore, we propose to commercialize a new class of clinical-grade wearable activity monitor, called the Vera Band, designed specially to be integrated into healthcare workflows. The Vera Band will provide a low-profile, durable, ultra-low-cost wearable and supporting service that presents no technical burden to patients or clinicians and can collect accurate daily activity data. Phase I of this Fast-Track application will consist of both Aims 1 and 2, each 1-year in duration. We will first conduct an iterative technical design and laboratory verification process, along with establishing the required technical and regulatory infrastructure to provide the proposed service (Aim 1). We will then assess its usability and workflow integration and verify its technical equivalence against a leading FDA-approved actigraphy monitor used in clinical research (Aim 2). By the conclusion of Aim 2, we propose to obtain FDA 510(k) clearance. During Phase II, we will conduct a multi- center clinical study, across four tertiary pain clinics, over a period of 3-years to determine physician satisfaction with device usability, and likelihood of clinical adoption (Aim 3).",U44,NS,NINDS,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10211966,U44NS122002,U44NS122002-01,122002,,,2021,1,224,Chris,,,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
422,Improving Overactive Bladder Treatment Access and Adherence Through Personalized Behavioral Modifications and Mobile Technology-Based Interventions,"Poor access and insufficient patient education regarding OAB chronicity, expected outcomes, costs, and potential side effects lead to unrealistic patient perceptions about therapy and suboptimal therapy duration, particularly in vulnerable populations. This thus leads to poor treatment access, adherence, and undertreatment. My long-term goal is to develop as an independently funded investigator and international leader who will pioneer interventions that improve OAB therapy access, adherence and outcomes, thereby reducing the burden of this chronic condition. The overall objective for this K23 proposal is to design an innovative, stakeholder-informed strategy that incorporates barriers to treatment (such as social determinants of health) and improves patient access to therapy options and therapy adherence. The central hypothesis is that unmet patient expectations and knowledge due to lack of access and suboptimal provider-to-patient OAB healthcare delivery are a barrier to treatment adherence. This central hypothesis will be tested pursuing two specific aims: 1. Evaluate an adapted UI mobile health tool for use in a diverse, multicultural population of women with OAB and identify barriers and facilitators to access, treatment adherence and engagement from multiple key stakeholders. 2. Conduct a pilot study to evaluate the usability and feasibility of using a mobile health tool to improve OAB knowledge, engagement and treatment plan adherence in a diverse group of women with OAB. The rationale for the proposed research is that its completion is expected to provide a strong evidence-based framework for the continued development and future implementation of cost-effective, evidence-based interventions to improve OAB therapy access and adherence. Combined these results are expected to have an important positive impact by positioning me to submit a competitive R01 application proposing a randomized controlled efficacy trial for improving therapy access, adherence, and OAB outcomes during the fourth year of this award.",K23,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10525607,K23DK131315,K23DK131315-01A1,131315,A1,,2022,1,228,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
428,Development of a Wireless Endovascular Nerve Stimulator for Treatment of Refractory Neuropathic Pain,"Neuropathic pain is a disabling pain syndrome caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system.14 For example, postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, amputation, and peripheral nerve injury are all associated with neuropathic pain.14 For patients with neuropathic pain refractory to medical therapy, modulation of specific neural structures in the central or peripheral nervous system, can provide effective alternative treatments.12,13 Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation is an approved therapy for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). The current FDA-approved device on the market for DRG stimulation is generally considered safe, but has been associated with complications such as pulse generator infections and lead migration.17, 18 Our overall goal is to provide a novel, minimally-invasive, and effective treatment for patients with refractory neuropathic pain. We propose a wireless millimeter-sized nerve stimulator that can be delivered through the vasculature and stimulate the DRG. This transformative ""endovascular nerve stimulation"" (EVNS) technology would have major advantages compared to state-of-the art nerve stimulation therapies for pain. This new concept for pain treatment using these small wireless endovascular stimulators is enabled by the development of magnetoelectric (ME) materials for wireless power delivery to bioelectronic devices.3 The goal of this project is to develop a wireless endovascular magnetoelectric nerve stimulator to stimulate the dorsal root ganglion and alleviate the symptoms of neuropathic pain. Successful completion of this project will establish proof-of-principle and provide early safety/efficacy data on wireless endovascular DRG stimulation for treatment of refractory neuropathic pain. Based on the successful demonstration of DRG stimulation, we will be able to develop EVNS therapies for other neuropathic pain targets. While in this proposal we focus on the treatment of CRPS, successful demonstration of EVNS will provide a platform technology for treating numerous other neuropathic pain syndromes. At the end of the 3-year period, we plan to submit for FDA clearance and to follow with a first in human study and a subsequent clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of wireless endovascular DRG stimulation in patients with refractory neuropathic pain.",U18,EB,NIBIB,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9932702,U18EB029353,U18EB029353-01,29353,,,2019,1,231,Pablo,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
436,Internet-based insomnia intervention to prevent cognitive decline in older adults with mild cognitive impairment,"Dr. Meghan Mattos is a nurse scientist with training in gerontological nursing, dementia care and management, sleep disorders, and digital health combined with clinical expertise in the care of patients with neurological disorders. Her current research, research funding, and history of dissemination demonstrate her ability to execute innovative, impactful research in older adults with cognitive impairment, specifically to improve quality of life and disease trajectory. Dr. Mattos's short-term career goals are to become an independent nurse researcher focused on the use of digital health in older adults and grow as a leader through additional formal leadership training. Her broad, long-term career goal is to implement effective, accessible interventions via the Internet for older adults to maintain cognitive health and well-being. The training and mentorship afforded by the NIA Beeson Career Development Award in Aging will allow her to gain expertise and receive mentorship in the conduct of rigorous Alzheimer's disease trials using digital therapeutics and Internet-based recruitment methods. This project will be conducted under the outstanding and complimentary mentorship of an international leader in digital health and Internet-based recruitment (Dr. Lee Ritterband), leader in the assessment of health outcomes in aging and chronic disease (Dr. Steven Albert), and nurse innovator and leader in cognitive impairment (Dr. Jennifer Lingler). The University of Virginia is committed to Dr. Mattos's development as a nurse scientist working in team science and provides the necessary facilities and resources to conduct the proposed research project. Building upon Dr. Mattos and her team's preliminary work, the proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the impact of an Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention on sleep and the extent to which it contributes to cognitive health in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Participants with insomnia who meet the study criteria for mild cognitive impairment will be recruited to determine the effects of the CBT-I intervention compared to a patient education control condition on sleep and cognition. Internet-based recruitment methods will be used, and outcomes include sleep variables (reduced overall insomnia severity and wake after sleep onset), daytime variables (reduced levels of fatigue, improved quality of life, and improved mood), and cognitive status (memory, attention/psychomotor speed, and executive functioning domains). This proposal will inform a future randomized controlled trial powered to detect the intervention effect on the slope of cognitive decline as well as provide Dr. Mattos training in 1) the conduct of rigorous and reproducible trials and 2) leading recruitment efforts using Internet-based settings and conducting digital health trials in older adults.

450,Medical Image Perception Society MIPS XVI,"MIPS XVI brings together an international community of experts including radiologists, pathologists, other image-based clinicians, psychologists, statisticians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists investigating the extraction of diagnostic information from medical images. The meeting forges research and learning opportunities for new students and young researchers in a dedicated forum unmatched by other meetings. MIPS XVI is being organized by the Medical Image Perception Society (a US-based society) in conjunction with local hosts Ljiljana Platisa, PhD, Asli Kumcu, MSc and Bart Goosens, PhD (University of Ghent), and Federica Zanca, PhD and Hilde Bosmans, PhD (University of Leuven). It will run June 3-5, 2015 at the Marriott Ghent located near the University of Ghent campus in Belgium. This is the fourth time MIPS will be held at an international site (1999 Canada; 2005 England; 2011 Ireland). Nine topic areas have been selected for MIPS XVI, reflecting important dimensions of medical image interpretation, along with a special theme that will run throughout these topic areas - 3D imaging. 3D or volumetric images are becoming increasingly common in radiology pathology and other clinical specialties but they present unique perceptual and cognitive challenges that perceptionists can address. Studying how clinicians extract diagnostic information from images identifies the causes of missed diagnoses and ways to eliminate these errors. Careful design and evaluation of imaging systems are critical in view of their enormous costs. With the current emphasis in the practice of medicine on ""meaningful use"" to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of care, the role the clinician as decision-maker cannot be ignored. Medical image perception research develops and applies modern methods to the evaluation of observer performance in diagnostic imaging tasks. Understanding basic aspects of the perception of medical images can reduce diagnostic error and improve medical decision-making quality. This grant will support 10 students to attend and present their research at MIPS XVI. To date, 93 students have been awarded scholarships. The primary goal in supporting these students is to create opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee's career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success.",R13,EB,NIBIB,EB;CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8908321,R13EB020477,R13EB020477-01,20477,,,2015,1,242,Audie,,,,,,,,,
456,"Imaging the Brain in Motion: The Ambulatory Micro-Dose, Wearable PET Brain Imager","Our vision is to design the first truly mobile molecular brain imager that can be used on healthy subjects to study the functioning of the human brain during motion. The ultimate goal is to be able to image subjects during a proverbial ""walk in the park"" and other natural activities. We selected PET technology as the most likely to succeed in the next decade to provide the desired functionality of such a brain imager. While MRI is an exceptionally powerful and versatile imaging modality, and there are even upright MRIs for structural brain scans, for functional fMRI scans the subjects must stay still and in horizontal position inside a narrow bore of a strong-field MRI magnet. What we propose is extremely challenging and cannot be realized without careful planning for its requirements and the approaches to achieve the desired performance. There are several major obstacles to overcome before an ambulatory use of such a brain imager can become feasible. The first challenge is that PET is a nuclear medicine modality and one needs to deal with the issue of radiation dose and safety to the ambulatory healthy subjects and to the personnel. Therefore, we have to (1) develop a strategy to substantially lower the radiation doses. We hypothesize that doses as low as 1-10% of the standard injection dose when imaging with the whole body PET/CT scanners will become possible, without adversely impacting the task-specific accuracy of imaging procedures. The second challenge is (2) availability and delivery of the appropriate radiolabeled PET imaging agents that, with the substantially increased sensitivity of the device, will be able to tag neural targets that were too low to detect with current PET technology. The third key challenge is (3) the design of the mechanics/robotics allowing comfortable and safe freedom of movement. Clearly the most critical, lowering of the radiation dose, depends on many factors, starting with the definition of the task-specific performance requirements, and optimizations through simulation and development of optimized reconstruction algorithms, through selection of the optimized detector design, and of the type of the radioactive label (C-11, O-15 vs F18, etc.). This multi-parametrical analysis can be only achieved through careful analysis and simulation, accompanied by detector component prototyping, having in mind the follow-up grant application(s) to propose development of the full prototype. The first and critically important aim of our planning grant will be to articulate clearly the need for such an ambulatory, highly sensitive PET imager and prepare a list of its applications and accompanying task- specific performances. We prepared a preliminary list justifying the validity of the ambulatory PET concept, but we need to deepen it and associate operational requirements with particular imaging tasks. We anticipate that from our planning discussions we may envision more than one design of the imaging system, as one universal system may not suffice.",R24,MH,NIMH,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8935951,R24MH106057,R24MH106057-02,106057,,,2015,2,245,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
461,Stepped-care management of insomnia co-occurring with sleep apnea,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and chronic insomnia are prevalent, debilitating, and challenging to treat, but their all too common co-occurrence amplifies morbidity and complicates the management of affected patients. Unfortunately, previous research provides limited guidance as to what constitutes the best and most practical management approach for this comorbid patient group. Various medications have FDA approval for insomnia management, but most have not been tested among comorbid OSA/insomnia patients. Moreover, many of these agents suppress respiratory drive making apnea symptoms worse, whereas others result in residual sedation, an unwanted side effect for the already sleepy OSA patient. Some promising preliminary data suggest that cognitive-behavioral insomnia therapy (CBT) may be a safe and effective adjunct to standard OSA therapies for comorbid OSA/insomnia. However, studies reporting these findings have included small patient samples, lacked both control groups and adequate follow-up periods, and failed to address how this promising therapy can be made more broadly accessible given the currently limited number of providers capable of delivering it. This dual-site randomized clinical trial will move the field forward by addressing the limitations of this previous studies. Specifically this project will use a ""SMART"" design to test a stepped care model relative to standard positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy and determine if (1) augmentation of PAP therapy with OCBT improves short-term outcomes of comorbid OSA/insomnia; and (2) providing a higher intensity 2nd-stage CBT to patients who show sub-optimal short-term outcomes with OCBT+PAP improves short and longer-term outcomes. The 384 PAP-treated comorbid OSA\insomnia patients enrolled will complete baseline assessment with sets of syndrome-specific measures as well as global measures of sleep/wake functioning. They then will be randomly assigned to a treatment consisting of the UC alone or PAP +OCBT. After 8 weeks they will be reassessed with all measures taken at baseline. Patients reaching remission status (insomnia severity index score < 10 + Quebec Sleep Questionnaire mean item score > 5) will be offered no additional insomnia intervention but will continue PAP and complete study outcome measures again after an additional 8-weeks and again at 3 and 6 month follow-ups. OCBT recipients classified as ""unremitted"" after 8-weeks of treatment will be re-randomized to a 2nd- stage treatment consisting of a continued, expanded engagement with the OCBT or a switch to a therapist- directed CBT (TCBT). Those receiving the 2nd-stage intervention as well as the UC group will be reassessed after another 8 weeks and then again at 3- and 6-month follow-up time points. Results should provide much new information that greatly enhances our knowledge about how to effectively treat comorbid OSA/insomnia patients and about the role of OCBT intervention in the short- and longer term management of this patient group.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9177299,R01HL130559,R01HL130559-01A1,130559,A1,,2016,1,231,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
466,Non-Invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation in Patients with Opioid Use Disorders,"Treatment of Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) includes medications with effects on opioid receptors such as buprenorphine, but access is limited for many patients and others are opposed to treating addictions with medications that have opioid agonist properties. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that is more acceptable for many patients, and recent studies show it to be equivalent in efficacy. Initiation of treatment with long-acting naltrexone, however, requires a period of abstinence of about seven days during which time patients suffer from intense symptoms of withdrawal with a risk of relapse that can lead to overdose-related death. Opioids have an inhibitory effect on norepinephrine and the sympathetic nervous system, and many symptoms of withdrawal are driven by rebound activation of these systems. Dopaminergic systems in brain areas including ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) and medial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate) play an important role in opioid addiction, craving and relapse, as do increases in inflammation. This project will assess a form of neuromodulation involving non-invasive electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve that may play a useful role during the period of opioid withdrawal before the initiation of long-term naltrexone treatment in blocking norepinephrine, sympathetic, and inflammatory responses and enhancing peripheral parasympathetic and central brain function in areas modulating drug craving (ventral striatum, anterior cingulate). Our preliminary data on the effects of non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) on stress response in traumatized human subjects and patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show that nVNS reliably blocks peripheral sympathetic and enhances parasympathetic function, reduces inflammatory responses (interleukin-6, or IL-6), and enhances central brain responses (anterior cingulate) to stress. We now propose to apply this technology to the treatment of patients with OUDs. Following verification using modelling and determination of optimal dosing parameters, we will use these parameters to assess effects of nVNS versus sham stimulation on opioid craving, peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and brain functional responses measured with High-Resolution Positron Emission Tomography (HR-PET) and radiolabeled water to videos of drug cues in recently treated patients with OUDs. Based on the outcome of this research, we will proceed to the UH3 phase, which will involve a randomized, sham-controlled trial of nVNS in patients with OUDs during the one to two week period of opioid withdrawal followed by assessment of craving, HR-PET imaging of both brain function and brain dopaminergic function, and assessment of peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular and inflammatory responses in conjunction with administration of nVNS or sham. We hypothesize that nVNS will reduce opioid craving and inflammatory, peripheral autonomic and cardiovascular responses and enhance brain responses (anterior cingulate function and dopamine function in ventral striatum), and promote successful conversion to long-acting naltrexone, in patients with OUDs.",UG3,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,9983431,UG3DA048502,UG3DA048502-01A1,48502,A1,,2020,1,250,Chris,,,,,,,,,
470,SurvivorCare: A digital health solution to support long-term cancer survivorship using patient navigation,"There is a growing and urgent need to address a gap in transitional and follow-up care for long-term cancer survivors shifting from oncology-based to primary and community-based care. Frontline health workers such as patient navigators and community health workers can support cancer survivors with the transition from oncology- based to primary care. The overall goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to refine and test SurvivorCare, a mobile- /web-based system to support long-term cancer survivorship through patient navigation for low-resource, underserved populations. Following a human-centered design approach and recommendations and learnings from Phase I pilot work, we will develop and test a functional web/mobile application expressly designed for patient navigators and other frontline health workers assisting with patient navigation and cancer survivors through a centralized platform supporting needs related to cancer survivorship care planning. We will achieve our project goal through 3 specific aims: • Specific Aim 1. We will build a functional prototype based on feedback collected in Phase I. Specifically, we will expand the scope of our Phase I work to include support for patients in early stages of survivorship with prevalent cancer types with survivorship care plans and/or patient navigation programs such as colorectal, breast, prostate, lung, and head/neck cancers. ● Specific Aim 2. We will conduct usability testing of a functional prototype with target end users (patient navigators and cancer survivors) to validate content and usability. ● Specific Aim 3. We will conduct beta testing in real-world clinical settings with target end users in two large, urban, safety net hospitals serving diverse, low-resource populations. Results from this project will go towards furthering research and implementation efforts in developing tools to promote collaboration and coordination between frontline health workers, cancer survivors, PCPs, and other cancer care team members to mitigate pronounced health disparities in long-term cancer survivorship.",R44,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,10321516,R44CA265301,R44CA265301-02,265301,,,2021,2,252,,,,,,,,,,
476,Sustainable Habits for Encouraging Even Teen Sleep (SHEETS): A Digital Intervention to Enhance Sleep Regularity and Psychiatric Health in Adolescents,"More than two-thirds of U.S. adolescents exhibit unhealthy sleep patterns. Sleep, which is a construct in the Arousal and Regulatory domain of RDoC, is a critical process supporting psychiatric health during adolescence. Specifically, sleep disturbances appear to represent a transdiagnostic risk factor for onset of internalizing and externalizing disorders as well as interfere with academic and social performance during this critical developmental period. Thus, preventative interventions to improve sleep among adolescents are necessary to support psychiatric health and functioning across the lifespan. Efficacious behavioral sleep strategies exist for adolescents. However, there has been limited translation of what is known to work in research and subspecialty care settings to community preventive and primary care practice settings, where most adolescents access social and health services. As well, much of the anticipatory guidance in primary care focuses on sleep duration, which may be difficult to improve upon for adolescents navigating multiple academic and extracurricular demands. In contrast, another critical aspect of sleep, the regularity of sleep-wake patterns, is associated with a range of psychiatric health and functional outcomes, and these relationships are shown to be independent of duration, suggesting enhancing sleep regularity may improve adolescent psychiatric outcomes even if duration remains constant. Recognizing the powerful connections between sleep, psychiatric wellness, and psychosocial function, there is a critical need to take efficacious behavioral strategies to improve sleep regularity among youth, and to optimize the delivery system to reach diverse youth in the primary care setting, the point of access for most youth seeking support for emotional and mental health. For the proposed project, we will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-week digital sleep regularity intervention (Sustainable Habits for Encouraging Even Teen Sleep; SHEETS) among a diverse population of adolescents, ages 13-15 years, and will explore a range of socio-environmental drivers of sleep regularity as they relate to intervention uptake. SHEETS uses a digital platform to deliver education on sleep regularity as a health prevention tool, motivational messaging, support for setting goals for consistent bed- and wake-times, and self- monitoring. Wearable sleep sensors (Garmin wristwatches) provide real-time feedback to adolescents about their sleep regularity. We will also evaluate the short-term effectiveness of SHEETS on sleep regularity, sleep practices, and psychiatric health (i.e., internalizing and externalizing symptoms, psychosocial function) among adolescents receiving health services in a primary care pediatric practice compared to an active control group, and will explore sleep regularity as a mediator of the relationship between SHEETS participation and better psychiatric health. Findings from this study will inform proposal development for an adequately-powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to optimize and evaluate scalable, easily disseminated digital sleep interventions that are acceptable and effective for youth living in a range of sociocultural contexts.",R34,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10355792,R34MH128440,R34MH128440-01,128440,,,2022,1,255,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
488,"Consumer-based meditation app, Calm, for treatment of sleep disturbance in hematological cancer patients","Hematological cancers, a group of cancer sub-types that include blood- and lymph-related disorders (i.e., leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), account for 11% of all cancer diagnoses in the US. Chronic hematological cancer (CHC) patients (i.e., chronic leukemias, low grade lymphomas, myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and myeloproliferative neoplasms [MPNs]) have extended disease courses that are often different from solid tumor cancers, facing chronic sleep disturbances often associated with inflammation, fatigue, and emotional distress (anxiety and depression), which often persist into survivorship. Medications are most commonly prescribed for cancer patients with sleep disturbance; however, they often come with side effects and risk for long-term dependence. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the most studied and first line of therapy for treating sleep disturbances in cancer patients, but CBT-I is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and not easily accessible for all cancer patients. There is a need for long-term, accessible, non-pharmacologic interventions targeting sleep in CHC patients. Meditation is a safe and effective non-pharmacologic approach for improving a range of cancer-related symptoms. However, meditation interventions have typically been delivered in-person, limiting uptake and widespread dissemination due to patient-reported barriers. Smartphone applications (apps) are a novel intervention approach for delivering meditation and address cancer patients' barriers to participating in in-person interventions (i.e., fatigue, pain, transportation, and scheduling difficulties) without the time and expertise limitations of CBT-I and side effect risks from medication. Calm is a popular and highly reviewed consumer- based smartphone app that provides an innovative, accessible and scalable platform through which to deliver meditation to CHC patients. We propose a double-blind RCT to determine the effectiveness of an eight-week ""app-based wellness"" intervention (i.e., active daily meditation intervention [Calm] or the placebo health education podcast control group [POD]) to reduce sleep disturbance (primary outcome), markers of inflammation (TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, and CRP) fatigue, and emotional distress (anxiety, depression) (secondary outcomes) in CHC patients. Assessments will occur at baseline, post-intervention (eight weeks from baseline), and follow-up (20 weeks from baseline). Participants (N=276) will be randomized to an intervention (10 min/day Calm meditation) (n=138) or control (10 min/day health education podcast) group (n=138). We will remotely collect blood samples for biomarker measurement. This study will fill a knowledge and rigor gap regarding the delivery of smartphone- based meditation as an intervention for sleep and provide new data on sustained effects in CHC patients to reduce sleep disturbance.",R01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10444598,R01CA262041,R01CA262041-01A1,262041,A1,,2022,1,261,Leonie,,,,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
497,Enhancing Sleep Duration: Effects on Children's Eating and Activity Behaviors,"Pediatric obesity has been labeled an epidemic with approximately 33% of children 6-11 years old being either overweight or obese. This marks a dramatic increase in pediatric obesity in the last 20 years. During this same time period, the number of children with insufficient sleep has also risen. Current estimates show that over one-half of school age children have shortened sleep duration. Epidemiological studies have found that shortened sleep duration is associated with increased risk of obesity in children. Experimental studies with adults suggest that less sleep may lead to increased risk for obesity through changes in the neuroendocrine control of hunger and appetite, which may influence food intake. Despite this mounting evidence, to our knowledge, no studies have assessed how an intervention to increase sleep duration affects children's eating behaviors. Furthermore, research has largely neglected to understand how enhancing sleep duration may affect engagement in physical and sedentary activities. The proposed study will therefore build upon previous research by determining whether enhancing sleep duration in children leads to changes in eating and activity behaviors. One hundred four children 8-11 years old who sleep 9 1/2 hours or less each night will be enrolled. Children will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions: 1) optimize sleep or 2) control (no change in sleep). Families of children in the optimize sleep group will receive effective behavioral strategies to increase sleep duration. At baseline, 2-week and 2-month follow-up, the following will be gathered: sleep duration, dietary intake, physical and sedentary activity, the relative reinforcing value (RRV) of food (i.e., how hard children work for food rewards), and child height and weight. Primary study aims are as follows: 1) to determine if the optimize sleep intervention leads to increases in sleep duration at 2-month follow-up, and 2) to determine if increased sleep leads to changes in caloric intake and percent calories from fat at 2-month follow-up. Secondary study aims will assess changes in the RRV of food, engagement in physical and sedentary activities, and changes in children's zBMI.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8774625,R01HL092910,R01HL092910-04,92910,,,2015,4,249,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
500,Noninvasive Monitoring of Atrial Fibrillation and Informatics to Prevent Stroke,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, affecting over 2.2 million Americans and growing. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is a self-terminating form of the cardiac arrhythmia that comprises between 25% and 60% of AF cases. PAF may be a single episode or clusters of abnormal rhythms with variable duration. PAF is often asymptomatic, and in those patients with symptoms, it has been estimated that for every symptomatic episode there are 10 asymptomatic ones. The self-terminating nature of PAF leads to its frequent under-diagnosis and consequent lack of use of established stroke prevention therapies. The proposed informatics screening tool ties clinical data collected in the home directly to the clinician; is completely unobtrusive and does not require surgical implantation. This system could identify even brief (5 minute) episodes of atrial fibrillation and prevent significant morbidity and mortality by identifying individuals wo would benefit from therapy, such as anticoagulation that significantly reduces stroke risk. The innovation of this project is a practical solution for providing such screening. A prototype device will be developed and evaluated in phase 1. The device will enable a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality in the US population.",R43,TR,NCATS,TR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9136985,R43TR001687,R43TR001687-01,1687,,,2016,1,267,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
503,2/2 Sickle Cell Disease and CardiovAscular Risk - Red cell Exchange Trial (SCD-CARRE Trial),"As patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) live to adulthood, the chronic impact of sustained hemolytic anemia and episodic vaso-occlusive events take their toll, with the progressive development of cardiopulmonary organ dysfunction. This culminates in the development of pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular diastolic heart disease, dysrhythmia, chronic kidney disease and sudden death, all major cardiovascular complications of SCD for which there are no approved or consensus therapies. The risk of having pulmonary hypertension and diastolic heart disease can be non-invasively assessed by laboratory tests (NT-proBNP) and Doppler- echocardiography (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure). A recent meta-analysis of approximately 6000 patients with SCD demonstrated that patients with elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV), which is an Doppler-echocardiographic measurement that estimates the pulmonary artery systolic pressure, walked an estimated 30.4 meters less in a 6 minute walk test than those without elevated TRV, and elevated TRV was associated with high mortality (hazard ratio of 4.9). In two large registry cohorts of adult patients with SCD, we found that approximately 20% of the adult SCD population have high values for both biomarkers, defined as a TRV ≥ 2.5 meters per second AND a NT-proBNP ≥ 160 pg/mL, and that the 12-month mortality rate is 7.9% in this group as compared to 0.5% in patients with normal TRV or NT-proBNP values, with a risk ratio for hospitalization of 1.6. This suggests that a simple screening profile of TRV and NT-proBNP can identify about 20% of patients with SCD at the highest risk of death and hospitalization. Given the increased mortality and early loss of functional capacity associated with cardiovascular disease in SCD adults, it is important to test effective therapeutic interventions in such patients. Red blood cell transfusions are administered by either simple or exchange transfusion, the latter removes the patients blood and replaces it with transfused red blood cells. Exchange transfusions have proven effective for acute treatment of almost all SCD complications, including severe acute chest syndrome, stroke, splenic or hepatic sequestration, and multi-organ failure, and are also used chronically for stroke prevention and recurrent acute chest syndrome. In this study we hypothesize that monthly exchange transfusion will limit disease progression, improve exercise capacity, and prevent interval episodes of vaso-occlusive painful crisis and the acute chest syndrome that acutely increases pulmonary pressures and cause right heart failure. We propose to perform a clinical trial to evaluate the effects of automated exchange blood transfusion on patient morbidity and mortality, compared to standard of care among 150 adult high risk SCD patients. The trial will leverage existing coordinating center infrastructure at the University of Pittsburgh and will involve 22 experienced clinical sites. Despite the safety and wide utilization of erythrocytapheresis in adult patients with SCD, there is no consensus or quality efficacy data on its use to improve outcomes in our aging high-risk SCD patients with progressive end-organ dysfunction.",U24,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9743419,U24HL143217,U24HL143217-01A1,143217,A1,,2019,1,252,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
519,Metabolic Effects of Sleep Extension in People with Obesity,"Data from both epidemiological and sleep intervention studies have shown that insufficient sleep causes metabolic dysfunction and is associated with an increased risk of developing obesity and metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, a comprehensive assessment of the potential therapeutic benefits of sleep extension have not been evaluated in people. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the effect of sleep extension on multi- system metabolic function and the potential mechanisms responsible for the link between insufficient sleep and metabolic dysfunction, including circadian misalignment, increased oxidative stress, plasma metabolomics and both systemic and adipose tissue inflammation in people with metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) who habitually maintain chronic short sleep schedules. Accordingly, we have assembled a transdisciplinary research team with expertise in metabolism (S. Klein, G. Smith at Washington University School of Medicine [WUSM]), sleep (K. Wright, J. Broussard at University of Colorado Boulder and B. Lucey [WUSM]), circadian biology and molecular science (J. Yoshino [WUSM]), and metabolomics (M. Jain at University of California San Diego) to conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess a 6-wk sleep extension intervention in people with MUO, who habitually sleep ≤6.0 h/night. We will determine the effect of sleep extension, on: 1) multi-organ insulin sensitivity (assessed by using the two-stage hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure in conjunction with stable isotope tracers), 2) 24h plasma glucose, free fatty acids and hormone profiles, and 3) intrahepatic triglyceride content (assessed by using magnetic resonance imaging) and the potential cellular mechanisms responsible for insufficient sleep-induced metabolic dysfunction, by targeted (circadian misalignment, clock genes, inflammation, and oxidative stress) and non-targeted (mass spectroscopy-driven metabolome) approaches. The results from this transdisciplinary collaboration will provide important insights into understanding the physiological and molecular interactions between sleep and metabolic function, and could provide evidence for sleep extension as a countermeasure to improve metabolic health in people at high risk for developing metabolic diseases.",R01,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9582330,R01DK115502,R01DK115502-01A1,115502,A1,,2018,1,260,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
520,"Translating an In-Person Brief, Bystander Bullying Intervention (STAC) to a Technology-Based - Phase II","While studies support the efficacy of comprehensive, school-wide interventions in reducing bullying, these types of programs can require significant time and financial resources for implementation, resulting in barriers to providing school-based bullying prevention, especially in low-income and rural communities. Additionally, although training bystanders to act as ""defenders"" on behalf of targets of bullying is an important intervention component, few programs include this as part of their comprehensive strategy. Brief programs that focus on bystander training and require fewer resources are needed to reduce bullying and its negative consequences. The PI (Dr. Midgett) developed STAC, a brief, stand-alone bullying bystander intervention for middle school students, to reduce bullying and mental health risks for bystanders. Brief, in-person programs, however, still pose implementation barrier such as training school personnel, providing external support, and not allowing for large groups of students to be trained at the same time. For this project, we propose to develop a technology- based STAC intervention (STAC-T) that will allow students to customize their experience by selecting avatars and bullying scenarios based on our previous studies conducted in a range of middle schools, including those in low-income and rural communities. We will also incorporate an assessment and personalized feedback component to promote behavior change. The innovative, user-centered design proposed will be inherently sensitive to cultural needs of students and identify personally-appropriate strategies. The specific aims of this application include building the program leveraging our prior work and expertise of an external advisory board, usability and effectiveness testing with middle school students and stakeholders to evaluate feasibility, and testing the efficacy of the program with a randomized controlled trial. The technology-based platform will increase the overall reach, impact, and sustainability of the STAC intervention for bullying prevention. It will substantially reduce cost to increase reach and its interactivity and algorithms can tailor program content to adapt it further for students attending low-income and rural schools. Thus, this low-cost, easy to disseminate technology-based bullying bystander intervention has the potential to have a substantial impact on the problem of bullying and the negative associated consequences for both students who are targets and bystanders in middle school when the problem of bullying peaks. There is a large market for the STAC-T intervention with approximately 100,000 public and private schools with middle-school grades in the United States.

521,DHEA augmentation of musculoskeletal adaptations to exercise in older women,"Exercise (Ex) is recommended for postmenopausal women to maintain or increase areal bone mineral density (aBMD), to improve muscular fitness and balance, and ultimately to prevent fractures. During exercise, joint- reaction and ground-reaction forces contribute to strain signals that are transduced via a mechanostat to osteocytes, causing region-specific adaptations in bone tissue. However, age-related declines in anabolic adrenal, gonadal, and somatotropic hormones may blunt this and other musculoskeletal adaptations to Ex. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is the major source of estrogen (E2) and testosterone (T) in postmenopausal women but adrenal DHEA production declines with age. E2 is essential for strain mechanotransduction and reduces bone resorption whereas T promotes bone formation, is anti-resorptive to bone, and anabolic to skeletal muscle. In older women, DHEA therapy (50 mg/day) increased serum E2 and T, lumbar spine aBMD, and fat-free mass (FFM, a surrogate for skeletal muscle mass). We propose that DHEA therapy, by providing androgenic and estrogenic hormonal support, will augment the effects of bone-loading exercise on aBMD and FFM in women with low aBMD (i.e., osteopenia). This population is our focus because low aBMD, an indicator of fracture risk, may be reversible. The mechanical stimulus will be progressive resistance exercises and jumping to impart moderate- to high-intensity joint- and ground-reaction forces on bone, 3 times weekly for 36 weeks. Our overall objective is to determine if the musculoskeletal adaptations to progressive, bone-loading Ex can be significantly augmented in postmenopausal women with low aBMD by restoring serum DHEAS to youthful levels. Aims 1 and 2 will determine whether DHEA augments the effects of Ex on changes in lumbar spine aBMD and FFM, respectively. We hypothesize that the increases in aBMD and FFM will be greater in Ex+DHEA than Ex+Placebo (PL) or DHEA alone. Secondarily, we will determine the effects of DHEA with or without Ex on changes in trabecular and cortical volumetric bone density (vBMD) and bone strength of the lumbar spine and proximal femur. These outcomes are essential to understanding bone properties that contribute to fracture resistance. Changes in serum sex hormones and bone turnover markers will be investigated as potential mediators of the changes in aBMD, vBMD, bone strength, and FFM. We will determine whether the changes in FFM mediate changes in aBMD, vBMD, or bone strength. To achieve these aims, postmenopausal women aged 60-80 years with low bone mass (hip or spine T-scores < -1.0 and > - 2.5) will be randomized to Ex+DHEA, Ex+PL, or DHEA alone for 36 weeks. Given the tightly integrated functional relation of skeletal muscle and bone, we are keenly interested in therapies that simultaneously benefit both systems. Anabolic therapies that increase aBMD and impart fracture resistance, rather than slowing bone loss, are needed for older women. Ex+DHEA includes 3 anabolic mechanisms - mechanical strain, estrogenic effects on strain signaling and bone metabolism, and androgenic stimulation of muscle and bone.",R01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9306564,R01AG053489,R01AG053489-01A1,53489,A1,,2017,1,261,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
523,Improving physical activity and gait symmetry after total knee arthroplasty,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in the U.S., and rates are rising rapidly. TKA results in decreased pain, increased range of motion, and improvements in some aspects of physical function for most patients. However, accumulating evidence shows that patients have persistent deficits in other critical outcomes following TKA. First, the majority of patients do not substantially increase physical activity beyond levels prior to TKA, remaining well below recommended levels. This has negative implications for both joint health and overall health. Second, gait asymmetries are common following TKA, such that patients often continue to load the non-surgical leg more heavily during walking, even when the post-surgical leg is pain free, placing the contralateral limb at risk for developing or worsening osteoarthritis. Our long-term objective is to improve post-TKA outcomes, particularly overall physical activity and joint loading symmetry, through implementation of a rehabilitation process that directly addresses these core domains. The objective of the proposed study is to conduct an exploratory trial of a novel Physical Activity and Symmetry (PAS) intervention, which addresses these persistent post-TKA deficits in the context of routine post-TKA physical therapy. The study specifically aims to obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of the PAS intervention, with respect to changes in: 1) objectively assessed physical activity and 2) peak load symmetry during gait using a novel insole device. The study will also assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PAS intervention. The trial will involve 72 patients enrolled during the course of routine post-TKA physical therapy who will be randomized either to the PAS intervention or an attention control group. The PAS intervention will be initiated by the treating physical therapist during the final visits of traditional in-person PT and will be continued via a phone call after four weeks and an in-person visit after eight weeks to monitor progress, address barriers to engagement, and advise on exercise modifications. The PAS intervention will utilize evidence-based strategies of brief motivational interviewing, goal-setting and connection with appropriate resources to assist participants with progressively increasing overall physical activity levels. Tailored balance exercises will be used to address joint loading asymmetries. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, eight weeks (following completion of PAS), and 6 months.

525,Adherence to Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis Guidelines in Hospitalized Elders,"There are important public health concerns related to inappropriate use of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis among medically ill hospitalized elderly patients with low risk of VTE occurrence. Specifically, use of anticoagulants (heparin products) for VTE prophylaxis when not medically indicated may be harmful, and is a major patient safety issue that also has a significant cost effect on health systems. To this end, the American College of Chest Physician (ACCP) 9th Edition guidelines explicitly recommend a risk-stratification approach, rather than universal use of anticoagulants for VTE prophylaxis. Even though many medical inpatients are at high risk for VTE, there are others whom do not have sufficient risk to warrant prophylaxis, and use in this population is inappropriate. The first aim of this application proposes to determine the magnitude and scope of inappropriate use of anticoagulant VTE prophylaxis in low risk older adults. This aim will be achieved by using data abstraction from the Duke University Health System electronic records to determine (1) the prevalence of low risk elders using criteria proposed by ACCP guidelines, and (2) anticoagulant VTE prophylaxis use in this group. Guideline directed use of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis also emphasizes mobility evaluation. Mobility is a key component of risk stratification. Poor mobility evaluation by providers may be a significant barrier to appropriate use of VTE prophylaxis. Our second aim proposes to determine whether level of mobility during hospitalization is being used to influence use and duration of VTE prophylaxis among medically ill hospitalized elders. To achieve this aim, we will collect prospective observational data to objectively measure inpatient mobility using patient mounted accelerometers during patient hospital stays. Our goal is to improve the appropriateness of use of VTE prophylaxis among those in which the risks of harm may outweigh the benefit. Results from our study will provide important insights about use of risk assessment, and the relationship between patient mobility and VTE prophylaxis. These results are critical to understanding how to take the next steps toward improving the appropriate use and safety of anticoagulants in hospitalized older adults. Information from this study could be used in future proposals to study interventions to ultimately improve hospital practice in the care of older adults. Our investigative team at Duke is unique since we have expertise in all key fields of study: geriatrics, hospital medicine, hematology, and physical activity, that also have a longstanding history of working well with each other. As such, this collaborative team and research plan is designed to provide the principal investigator with a foundation from which to pursue an independent career in geriatric and hospital medicine research.",R03,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8919212,R03AG048007,R03AG048007-02,48007,,,2015,2,263,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
535,Infant Sleep Patterns and Accelerated Growth Trajectories from Birth to 24 months,"The prevalence of childhood obesity in the United States remains at historically high levels despite evidence of a recent plateau in some communities. Evidence shows that even infants experienced a dramatic rise in excess weight in the past 20 years, implying that the roots of the epidemic can be found as early as infancy. Trends in insufficient sleep have paralleled the increasing trends in childhood obesity. Across infancy, childhood, and adolescence, sleep duration has decreased by 30 to 60 minutes over the last 20 years, with the most pronounced decreases in sleep among children under 3 years of age. Mounting epidemiologic evidence indicates that short duration of sleep is a risk factor for obesity. We and others have observed an inverse association between sleep duration and obesity in longitudinal studies of children, even as young as infancy. Yet, major questions remain regarding the extent to which patterns of sleep other than short sleep duration predict infant growth and energy balance including sleep consolidation/fragmentation, day-to-day variability in sleep patterns, and sleep timing. Prior studies in children are also limited by a reliance on parent report of sleep rather than use of validated, objective measures such as actigraphy. Furthermore, few studies have tested mechanisms linking sleep and growth in infants. Adverse sleep patterns may promote accelerated infant weight gain through effects on feeding behaviors and neurobehavioral pathways including decreased self- regulation of eating, behavior, and emotion. Finally, there are gaps in our understanding of contextual determinants of infant sleep which could inform intervention development. The goals of this study are three- fold. First, we will examine modifiable determinants of infant sleep patterns that will directly inform interventions to improve sleep and growth patterns in the first 24 months of life. Second, we will examine associations of infant sleep patterns with growth from birth to 24 months of age. Third, we will explore feeding and neurobehavioral pathways linking adverse sleep patterns to early childhood obesity. We will carry out this project within a cohort of 400 infants, and their caregivers, that will be recruited from a large newborn nursery in Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and leverage the existing electronic health records from their pediatric primary care visits across the MGH health care system. This study will focus on an ethnically and socio-economically diverse sample of newborns and their families, and use parent report, in home observations, and actigraphic estimates of sleep. The results of this study could strengthen our understanding of the role of sleep patterns on infant growth trajectories in early life. Furthermore, our study will supply key data needed for the design of future intervention studies, such as examining sleep patterns that confer increased risk of obesity, identifying important proximate behaviors that mediate these associations, and identifying socio-cultural/environmental factors as potential targets for sleep improvement interventions.",R01,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9015082,R01DK107972,R01DK107972-01,107972,,,2015,1,268,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
548,Innovative Smartphone Application for Quitting Smoking among Seriously Mentally I,"The long term goal of this Pathway to Independence Award (PIA) is to develop a program of research focused on increasing the effectiveness and reach of smoking cessation interventions for adults with serious mental illness (SMI) using mobile health technology. This long term goal will be achieved via a 5-year training and research plan that will launch Dr. Roger Vilardaga's independent program of research and academic career. The career objectives of this award are to: (1) become an expert in the science of behavioral smoking cessation interventions; (2) master the development, testing and implementation of mobile health interventions; (3) become an expert in the implementation of clinical trials in people with SMI. These career objectives will be achieved via formal coursework, trainings, seminars, national conferences, mentorship and research experience. The knowledge derived from this training plan will equip the PI to pursue the following aims. The first aim, guided by an expert panel, is to adapt an existing Acceptance and Commitment Therapy smartphone application for smoking cessation (SmartQuit) to people with SMI, and develop a smartphone coaching guide for staff. The second aim is to conduct iterative usability testing of the resulting app (SmartQuit+) and coaching guide in a sample of 10 people with SMI. Finally, the third aim is to conduct a two-arm feasibility randomized trial that compares SmartQuit+ to an app based on best-practice smoking cessation guidelines (NCI QuitPal) in a sample of 90 people with SMI from a community-based setting. Both arms will include a low cost pharmacological intervention (nicotine replacement therapy). The primary feasibility outcomes in this trial (e.g., recruitment and retention rates) will determine a reliable methodological approach to conduct a fully-powered R01 trial. Dr. Jonathan Bricker will serve as primary mentor on this PIA, providing expertise in smoking cessation, ACT applied to smoking cessation, and mobile health interventions. The mentoring and consulting team of experts in SMI, smoking cessation, computer science and methods/statistics (Drs. Ries, Ziedonis, Saxon, Kientz and Atkins), will ensure that the PI receives the necessary support to successfully complete the proposed research. The training activities will take place at the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, two cutting-edge research institutions that will provide an excellent environment for completion of the PI's objectives. This study meets NIDA's major programmatic priorities of using innovative technologies and integrating behavioral and pharmacological interventions to improve substance use treatment and outcomes (NOT-DA-10-019). The study addresses a serious problem - high smoking rates in people with SMI-, and it proposes the delivery of a promising behavioral intervention for smoking cessation in a ""real-world"" setting using a wider reaching technology. This PIA will forge the PI's pathway to independence by laying the foundation for a career in mobile health interventions for smoking cessation in people with SMI.",K99,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8828659,K99DA037276,K99DA037276-02,37276,,,2015,2,292,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE
552,Mobile technologies for delivering hearing care through community health workers,"R21 R33 Summary/Abstract Hearing loss is a major and growing public health concern, especially in low and middle income countries (LMICs) where about 80% of the world's population with hearing loss reside. Our vision is to provide good quality, affordable, and sustainable hearing health care to underserved populations in LMICs and around the world. We propose to validate and then trial an innovative mHealth model for end-to-end hearing care facilitated by community health workers (CHWs). The smartphone-based solution uses hearing aids to first test hearing and then, if needed, programs the devices to provide gold standard rehabilitation. In the course of fifteen minutes, the user and their family should be able to experience a step change in their communicative ability. Following the fitting session, support will continue through innovative mHealth messaging support for their new hearing aids and communication with the CHW for troubleshooting. In the R21 phase of this funding, we will address three aims that validate key steps on the journey to better hearing for all. For Aim 1, we will perform clinical work in Cincinnati, Ohio and community work with CHWs in low-income South African communities to confirm that the hearing aids deliver hearing test precision to the highest standard. This audiometry will be part of a more comprehensive diagnostic package involving novel physical (smartphone video otoscopy) and behavioral (speech-in-noise) data. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the performance of the hearing aids to gold-standard and conventional clinical fitting standards. In a community setting, we will also determine usability by including CHWs and users. Training and supporting CHWs is critical for our approach and in Aim 3 we will work with our colleagues in the hearX Foundation to develop new training modules. Multiple techniques will be used to engage CHWs in each stage of the process, for example, adjusting existing modules found to be useful in previous hearing screening outreach. Freshly hired CHWs will test-drive and evaluate the training. Another part of this aim is to begin developing the mHealth user support system (apps) to be used in the clinical trial phase (Aims 4 and 5). Infographics and voice bytes will be translated to the local language (e.g. Xhosa) in an approach, using WhatsApp, we have shown to improve knowledge about hearing loss of preschool teachers. In the R33 phase of funding, the focus narrows to two clinical trials. In the first (Aim 4), we ask whether the smartphone-based, CHW-facilitated hearing aids successfully deliver benefit for their users. In the second trial (Aim 5) we ask whether an mHealth user support system, developed in Aim 3, is effective in delivering benefit. Both studies are randomized control trials, the highest level of clinical scrutiny. In Aim 6, we will model data from Aims 1-5 using AI towards a holistic hearing assessment. Positive, self-report outcomes and modeling should pave the way for an expansion to the next level, regional and national trials that, if successful, will be of huge personal importance for millions of individuals in LMICs. They will also open the gate to international adoption of this innovative, mHealth driven, community-based model of hearing care.",R21,DC,NIDCD,TW;DC,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10525540,R21DC019598,R21DC019598-01A1,19598,A1,,2022,1,294,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
560,Environmental Challenges and the Aging Brain: Implications for Community Mobility,"Mobility limitations are common and costly. Community mobility is an individual's movement that occurs outside the home and occurs within complex environments. Therefore, the interactions of an individual with the environment must be considered to fully understand how mobility limitations arise. The association of subclinical central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities with mobility in older adults free from neurologic disease is beginning to be established but is typically not studied in relation to environmental challenges. The first aim of this proposal is to characterize the relation between CNS characteristics, peripheral contributors, and community- based environmental challenges in a group of community-dwelling older adults. The second aim will develop and validate lab-based environmental challenges that reflect performance in actual community environments. This proposal incorporates several innovations that will allow me to better assess how the aging brain affects negotiation of real-world environmental challenges: 1) use of community-based environmental challenges in the lab to test community mobility 2) use of wearable, wireless functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for assessment of functional brain changes while participants are walking and 3) a multimodal neuroimaging approach that combines functional measurements from fNIRS with structural imaging. To successfully complete this research, I propose four training aims: 1) Acquire skills in measurement of gait in the lab and the real world; 2) Become an expert in use of near-infrared spectroscopy in mobility research; 3) Acquire advanced skills in in instrument development and testing; and 4) Continue to develop leadership and professional skills. These training aims will help me to achieve my immediate goals of establishing the relation between brain aging and limitations in community mobility as well as my long term goals of better understanding the contributors to community mobility in order to inform future intervention strategies. This research will establish the association between CNS function and negotiation of community-based environmental challenges, will establish the validity of tools for use in future studies, and will provide evidence towards novel intervention strategies to improve community mobility of older adults.",K01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9164180,K01AG053431,K01AG053431-01,53431,,,2016,1,298,Audie,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
561,Increasing aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity in Latinas via interactive web-based technology,"Cancer is the leading cause of death among Latinos in the U.S. While engaging in a physically active lifestyle is one of the most important modifiable behaviors for reducing cancer risk; few Latinas achieve health- enhancing levels of physical activity (PA) recommended by the National PA Guidelines, particularly for muscle- strengthening activities (MSA). For instance, 44% of Latinas meet the national guidelines for aerobic PA but only 17% meet the full guidelines for both aerobic and MSA. While the benefits of aerobic MVPA are well established for cancer and chronic disease prevention, participating in regular MSA may be key to further reducing cancer risk, as adherence to MSA guidelines has been associated with a 19% to 31% lower cancer mortality risk, independent of aerobic PA. There is a need for interventions promoting MSA in Latinas. However, only a select few MSA interventions have included Latinas in their sample, and none to our knowledge, were designed exclusively for this group or addressed socio-cultural factors influencing Latinas' muscle-strengthening behaviors (e.g., perception that MSA is for men; MSA is an avoided topic in their culture and social circles; belief that women should only do certain types of MSA). Moreover, existing interventions often involved in-person exercise programs, which can be inaccessible to many Latinas due to barriers such as lack of transportation or fear of immigration enforcement. Our research team has previously developed and tested aerobic moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) interventions for Latinas that overcome barriers to in-person programs and address PA-related socio-cultural factors. These theory-driven, individually tailored interventions have shown success at increasing aerobic MVPA among Latina women in both print and Internet-based randomized controlled trials. Thus, our web-based intervention (Pasos Hacia la Salud), in particular, provides an ideal platform for promoting muscle-strengthening PA in this at-risk population. To address the gap in literature on muscle-strengthening PA, we recently conducted qualitative interviews with 19 Latinas to identify theory-based barriers and facilitators of muscle-strengthening PA, then developed MSA intervention materials and are further refining for cultural appropriateness, relevance, and appeal in Latinas. In the proposed research, we will incorporate the newly developed MSA promotion materials into our existing Pasos Hacia la Salud (Pasos) web-based aerobic MVPA intervention and conduct a 12-week fully online randomized pilot trial testing the preliminary efficacy of the newly adapted web-based aerobic plus MSA intervention for Latinas. Fifty Latina adults (i.e., aged 18-65 years) will be randomized to either the: 1) original Pasos aerobic MVPA intervention arm, or 2) a Pasos aerobic MVPA plus MSA intervention arm. Our study aims to 1) Assess the preliminary efficacy of the aerobic and muscle-strengthening intervention for increasing MSA, and 2) Explore potential mediators and moderators of MSA. This interactive and highly disseminable approach can achieve significant health improvements in an at-risk population.",R03,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10289806,R03CA252500,R03CA252500-01A1,252500,A1,,2021,1,281,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
563,PALS-CATCH Intervention for Obesity Prevention Among At-Risk Toddlers,"In Texas, even the youngest children are affected by the obesity epidemic with 32% of 2 to 5 year old children overweight or obese before they enter school. The home environment and parenting skills and practices during the very early years of a child's life are critically important to establish obesity prevention behaviors such as healthy eating, physical activity, and adequate duration of sleep. However, parents lack these skills and interventions targeting the child's familiar environment, their home, are sparse. The overall aim of this study is to pilot test an integrated, culturally sensitive home-based program targeting predominantly low- income, African American and Hispanic parents to improve parenting skills for obesity prevention and control among toddlers ages 2 to 3 years. The program, PALS-CATCH, will integrate strategies from two research proven programs - Play and Learn Strategies (PALS) and the Coordinated Approach to Child Health (CATCH). This experimental study will target parents of toddlers in their home setting, teaching them how to be responsive and sensitive to their young child's cues, provide opportunities and assure consistency in young children's schedules for mealtime, activity, and sleep, thus facilitating child's development of self-regulation and other developmental outcomes to facilitate healthy eating, activity, and sleep patterns. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of PALS-CATCH among predominantly low-income, African American and Hispanic overweight or obese toddlers ages 2 to 3 years and their parents. Aim 2. To determine the effect of PALS-CATCH on child energy balance-related behaviors. We will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to pilot test PALS-CATCH among 60 low-income, African American and Hispanic parent-child dyads where the child is overweight or obese (BMI >85th percentile for age and gender). We hypothesize that post-intervention, as compared to those in the control group, children of parents receiving PALS-CATCH will decrease: a) BMI z-score, and b) ounces of sugar-sweetened beverages consumed per day, and increase: e) number of servings of fruits and vegetables consumed per day and, f) mean minutes of physical activity including moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day. As part of our secondary aims, we will evaluate the effects of PALS-CATCH on parent and child psychosocial and behavioral outcomes including parenting skills, responsiveness, and child self-regulation behaviors related to diet, physical activity, screen time and sleep. We will also examine the extent to which these factors mediate the improvements in child BMI, dietary and physical activity behaviors. Pre and post-intervention measurements will be conducted using child anthropometric measurements, parent-reported 24-hour dietary recalls for child dietary intake, accelerometers for child physical activity, video observations measuring parent responsiveness behaviors and, parent surveys measuring home environmental, and psychosocial factors. Results from the pilot will be used obtain effect sizes to power a RO1 to determine the efficacy of PALS-CATCH for toddlers.",R21,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8969509,R21HL122618,R21HL122618-01A1,122618,A1,,2015,1,282,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
570,Remotely Delivered Cardiac Rehabilitation for Adolescents with Congenital Heart Disease,"Adolescents with congenital heart disease [CHD], including repair of tetralogy of Fallot [TOF], dextro-transposi- tion of the great vessels [d-TGA], or functionally univentricular heart physiology [Fontan], have lower cardiorespir- atory fitness [FIT] compared with healthy peers. FIT is a well-established predictor of morbidity, quality of life [QOL], and heart transplantation and is among the strongest predictors of mortality in this population. However, adolescents with CHD have significantly lower FIT when compared to cardio-typical peers, due to abnormal hemodynamics as well as low durations and intensities of physical activity [PA] and exercise. Pediatric cardiac rehabilitation [CR] programs which prescribe aerobic and resistance exercise over 12-wks. have demonstrated improvements in FIT for patients with CHD which persist months after completion of the program. Unfortunately, few hospitals/clinics offer CR programming for children and adolescents due to the financial costs of building and maintaining a CR facility, as well as the travel cost, time requirement, and burden for parents/caregivers to transport their child to/from a hospital for CR exercise sessions multiple times per week. In-home CR reduces barriers related to patient access and the financial burden for hospitals, though data supporting the effectiveness of in-home CR for youth is limited. The use of group video conferencing technology via tablet computer repre- sents a novel and potentially transformational strategy for delivering real-time, live, supervised CR to groups of adolescents with CHD in their homes. The goal of this K23 research plan is to evaluate the effectiveness of video conferencing for the delivery of real-time CR to groups of adolescents with CHD in their homes. We propose a 12-wk. randomized-controlled clinical trial assigning 74 adolescents [12-19 years old] with 1 of 3 CHD diagnoses [Fontan, TOF, or d-TGA] to Remote CR [RCR] [in-home, live, remote group exercise, 3-45-min sessions/week.] or Active control [in-home, self-directed exercise]. Our aims will assess the effectiveness of the RCR approach by comparing between-group changes [0-12 weeks] in: FIT, cardiac function, lean body mass, and frailty. Ex- ploratory aims will assess between group differences [0-12 weeks] in physical function, QOL, PA self-efficacy, and will evaluate the impact of demographic characteristics on program participation and satisfaction, and daily PA. We hypothesize the RCR intervention will elicit greater improvements in each outcome compared to the control group. The PI's short term career development goal of enhancing knowledge, skills, and experiences in clinical trials research, CHD physiology, and implementation and dissemination [I&D] outcomes research in youth with CHD will be accomplished through a multidisciplinary team of mentors, formal programming/coursework, independent study, and scientific meetings. Career development training and experiences and data from the research plan will prepare the PI to accomplish his long-term career goals to 1] establish an independently funded research program conducting clinical trials to evaluate the impact of exercise, FIT on physical and psy- chosocial function in youth with CHD; and 2] I&D of CR programs across multiple sites.",K23,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10448915,K23HL159325,K23HL159325-01A1,159325,A1,,2022,1,304,Tom,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
576,Measuring human behavior and ecological dimensions of pathogen transmission for outbreak control and prevention,"This project proposes interdisciplinary research across biology and geography to examine links between human-environment interactions, spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility and health geographies, and endemic and emerging infectious diseases. This work focuses on measles and Ebola prevention and management in the Équateur province in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where both pathogens cause significant morbidity and mortality. Recurring outbreaks emphasize an urgent need for significant public health improvements. This research investigates the mechanisms underlying pathogen transmission and identifies epidemiological units, across which transmission occurs, and measure their vulnerability to outbreaks. Outputs will be developed with and for mobile health teams in the DRC and will provide a generalizable blueprint for the broader application of this approach across a range of contexts. The proposed research targets the intersection of theoretical frameworks to examine four interlinked topics. First, following Cutter in 2003, this project will develop formal spatial methods to identify and delineate epidemiological units of pathogen transmission and measure their epidemiological vulnerability. Vulnerability is determined by the mechanisms underlying locally specific transmission processes, which differ across diseases. This work includes health data quality as a problem that allow public health problems to persist where they most need improvement. Second, building on Kwan's 2013 work, this research will start with R1's epidemiological units and vulnerability indices and integrate the dynamics of seasonal and long-term population mobility, connectivity, and distribution. Population dynamics drive contacts, transmission, and spread for communicable pathogens and must be included in vaccinations and outbreak response. Third, extending Shuurman's 2011 work, this research will visually represent these dynamic epidemiological units and vulnerability indices cartographically to advance methods in geovisualizations and provide usable spatial decision support systems (SDSS) for mobile health efforts. To maximize clarity and usability, these visualizations will be rigorously developed and tested with our collaborating humanitarian organization's field teams and graduate students in infectious diseases and geography. Fourth, this work will develop dynamic quantitative models to produce formal comparisons of intervention strategies and iteratively improve them. Models will compare A) strategies using the proposed SDSS, which highlight acting on the vulnerability of epidemiological units of transmission before outbreaks occur for immunizations and outbreak responses and B) the current system, which is guided by administrative boundaries and case rate thresholds to trigger response. Linking spatial and temporal elements of human-environment interactions to support infectious disease prevention and outbreak management will significantly advance the current methods and theory in this field.",R01,TW,FIC,TW,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10596727,R01TW012434,R01TW012434-01,12434,,,2022,1,307,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
584,Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring,"Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years, and rotator cuff repair is a standard surgical procedure with nearly 500,000 procedures performed annually. In the United States alone the direct costs are over $7 billion per year. There is a relatively high rate of retears: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a protracted process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloaded by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. There is an inherent conflict in immobilizing the shoulder to protect the repair and mobilizing the shoulder to prevent stiffness. Teaching the patient passive exercises that do not activate contraction of the supraspinatus muscle is challenging and very difficult to monitor. To address this unmet need, we have developed a wearable sensor that provides direct real-time continuous biofeedback of muscle activity, joint angle, skin temperature, and swelling to enable passive shoulder exercises while minimizing muscle contraction. To test and validate this device we propose to the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: Design, manufacture, and test a wearable device with surface EMG (sEMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU), temperature, and bioimpedance sensors. Aim 2: Measure accuracy of Active4D sEMG and IMUs relative to standard clinical measurements. Active4D is a surgeon-driven company devoted to enhancing patient recovery from surgery by leveraging new technology. Active4D's unique wearable sensor provides continuous long-term sensor augmented biofeedback to patients and enables remote patient monitoring for surgeons. The device measures seven physiologic metrics in real time - muscle activation, joint range of motion, skin temperature, swelling, activity, gait, and fall risk. Real time physiologic data will increase safety, improve outcomes, and enhance patient experience while lowering the cost of rehabilitation and complications. Unique artificial intelligence driven algorithms can decrease complications through predictive analytics which enable early detection and intervention for high risk patients. The specific innovation to the application of rotator cuff repair, is the instantaneous feedback of muscle activity and motion which can accelerate recovery while reducing the risk of retears. At the successful completion of Phase I, we plan to launch a clinical trial comparing the outcomes of rotator cuff repair in patients guided by the A4D device in comparison to the current standard of postoperative rehabilitation. Active4D is a small business with the objective of developing smart wearables, which integrate multiple biological and environmental sensors, wireless communication, computer models, and data analysis for providing feedback and remote monitoring, to enhance surgical rehabilitation and improved patient outcomes in orthopaedics. Co-founders Drs. Hoenecke and D'Lima have extensive experience in shoulder surgery and rehabilitation, multi-center clinical trials, and biomechanics research; and have successfully executed challenging projects such as implantation of innovative electronic knee designs and development of new shoulder implants. Dr. Hoenecke has over 30 years of experience in the practice of sports medicine with an emphasis on shoulder repair and reconstruction. He provides care for elite athletes and is design surgeon for two shoulder implants.

604,Magneto-electronic Sensing of Cancer in Urine,"/ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States and one key challenge for bladder cancer is the high recurrence rate after initial treatment1-3. Furthermore, a number of medical and environmental conditions are associated with higher incidence of bladder cancer. Therefore, regular surveillance of bladder cancer is critical in subpopulations to detect disease early, prevent relapse and progression and improve overall survival. The current gold standard of bladder cancer detection is cystoscopy, which is invasive and expensive. Existing urine-based testing methods for bladder cancer have not been widely adopted in clinical practices either due to low test sensitivity and specificity (conventional cytology, ELISA), or technical complexities, long turn-around time and high cost (RT-qPCR, sequencing)2-6. To address these challenges, Accure Health proposes to commercialize a non-invasive, fast, affordable and highly accurate diagnostic platform based on integrated magneto-electronic sensing (iMES) of urine exosomes (or extracellular vesicles, EVs). EVs have emerged as a new class of biomarker for cancer management detectable in urine, circulation and other body fluids. These secreted vesicles carry molecular information from their originating cells7-12, and capturing this information can provide a representative, real-time window to monitor tumor burden13-15. A variety of EV biomarkers have been investigated to specifically detect tumor originating EV16-20. One critical unmet need to harness the translational potential of EV is to develop more integrated, highly sensitive, and easy-to-use clinical systems since purification and conventional analytics are often too complex, time consuming and expensive. In preliminary work we have developed and validated the easy-to-use and sensitive iMES technology, which seems ideally suited for point-of-care diagnostics for bladder cancer. We now propose to further improve the user interface, miniaturize the sensor for commercialization and perform correlative benchmarking measurements against accepted gold-standards. We also plan to develop several ""smart diagnostic"" modules, including smart-device communication and cloud- based data management. We believe that, by connecting patients and doctors through smart devices and cloud-based resources, patient care and disease management can be significantly improved. This Phase I proposal will focus on two specific Aims: (i) Develop a ""smart iMES platform"" for rapid and sensitive urine biomarker analysis; and (ii) apply the new iMES platform to screen urinary EVs for bladder cancer detection. Successful completion of this Phase I project will result in a product prototype ready for direct analyses of urine samples from bladder cancer patients. During a subsequent Phase II, we will perform clinical testing with key partners.

Throughout low and middle-income countries (LMICs), non-communicable diseases (NCD), including cancer, are a rapidly growing concern. It is estimated that by 2030 cancer incidence will more than double in LMICs, and 9 million people will die each year from the disease. The majority of patients in LMICs present with late-stage, incurable cancer and need quality pain management. Palliative care is a health care specialty that has evolved to holistically address the symptom management needs of patients and families coping with life-limiting illness, such as advanced cancer. A foundational principle of palliative care is quality pain management. However, in many LMICs this is complicated by a lack of knowledge among healthcare providers and difficulty obtaining effective pain relief medications, such as morphine. Nepal is a low-income country with a growing cancer burden and significant palliative care needs. In 2009, the Nepalese Association of Palliative Care (NAPCare) was formed by community stakeholders and healthcare providers to address the growing need for palliative care within the country. NAPCare has been instrumental in building educational capacity related to palliative care in Nepal, in part by creating Pain Management Guidelines (PMG) based on World Health Organization (WHO) standards and grounded in the Nepalese context. The longitudinal and sustained efforts of NAPCare demonstrate a readiness to embark on the next level of palliative care development - moving the research enterprise forward. Research has been proposed as a fifth pillar in the WHO Public Health Strategy for Palliative Care, but very little palliative care research has been conducted in LMICs, where palliative care needs are most pressing. Mobile technology ('mHealth') offers a scalable and sustainable approach to address this critical health gap. This proposal partners oncology palliative care leaders of NAPCare with oncology/palliative care and global health researchers at the University of Virginia to leverage mHealth to improve the delivery of palliative care and cancer pain management in Nepal. Our efforts will establish a model for NCD implementation research and research capacity building that generalizes to other LMICs and low- resource settings. Using principles of Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) within 4 diverse oncology care settings in Nepal we aim to: 1) Assess and describe contextual barriers and facilitators that influence adherence to the PMG; 2) Design and pilot test a decision support mHealth 'app' for oncology providers that will promote PMG implementation; and 3) Integrate tailored Research Enhancement Activities (REA) to strengthen research capacity within Nepal, including relevant course work, intensive mentoring, and creation of a 'Virtual Library' of research resources relevant to the LMIC context.",R21,TW,FIC,TW,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9614181,R21TW011244,R21TW011244-01A1,11244,A1,,2018,1,325,Chris,,,,,,,,,
617,APP-ME: Addressing Place & People MicroEnvironments in weight loss disparities,"Multi-site RCTs have shown that every 2lbs of weight loss is associated with a 20% reduction in the 3yr risk of hypertension and a 32% reduction in the 3yr risk of type 2 diabetes. This is equivalent to the stroke risk reduction associated with smoking cessation. Unfortunately, in intervention trials dating back to 1990, black women have experienced 50% less weight loss than white women. Thus, lifestyle weight loss interventions may actually increase racial disparities in morbidity; all 5 leading causes of death among black women are obesity-related. Obesity prevalence among the urban poor is very high and obesity research in the urban poor is an IOM and DHHS priority. Starting in 2006, we worked with the 3rd largest safety-net health system in the U.S. to implement a lifestyle weight loss intervention that operates in its 8 Federally Qualified Health Centers. This program too has resulted in 50% less weight loss in black relative to white women. We also have an ongoing weight loss RCT testing the impact of delivering the intervention into the homes of the urban poor. No outcomes are available yet but it too is a person-centric lifestyle intervention. With a goal of improving weight loss outcomes, we successfully piloted a novel approach to assessing micro- environments that coincide with weight-related behaviors including momentary social interactions and emotions. Literature places a very strong emphasis on the role of social micro-environments in obesity and weight loss disparities. Individuals are often unaware of the influence of micro-environments on their behavior. For example, experiments have shown that we consume up to 70% more calories when eating with others and that we are largely unaware we have done so. Previous research suggests social networks of black women are less supportive of weight loss than are those of white women. Such social networks may lead to more exposures to obesity, food, eating, sedentary activities, and acceptance of these. In fact, a recent year-long study that captured objective assessments of social interactions among first year dormitory residents found the number of interactions with weight gaining others accounted for 1/3rd of the variance in one-year weight gain. We seek in the proposed study to assess, compare, and test the influence of social and physical micro- environments and emotions on inactivity and eating in 300 urban poor black and white women. Our Aim 1 involves novel data collection via GPS, Bite Counters, and accelerometers to obtain location and behavior data and a hybrid of ecological momentary assessment and the day reconstruction method to obtain social interaction and emotion data. In our Aim 2 randomized trial, these data are used to test hypotheses about micro-environments and weight change. Each individual's Aim 1 data are used to test whether messages in the form of health-related words and images at the time and location each woman's data indicate she is vulnerable to eating or sedentary activity affect weight change.

620,Heart Steps: Adaptive mHealth intervention for physical-activity maintenance,"Many of the risk factors for heart disease are behavioral, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and diets high in saturated and trans-fats. Cardiac rehabilitation and other secondary prevention programs are effective at helping cardiac patients make the initial lifestyle changes needed to reduce their risks, but patients often fail t maintain those changes after the program ends. In this grant, the investigators propose to develop a novel mHealth application for supporting maintenance of physical activity after cardiac rehabilitation. By taking advantage of the frequent interactions that individuals have with their mobile phones throughout the day, the investigators will design and evaluate an adaptive, personalized application that (1) keeps patients reminded of their health goals, increasing the likelihood that they will notice opportunities to engage in physical activity; (2) provides actionable ideas for how patients can be active right now, given their current context; and (3) helps patients plan and reflect on their physical activity to enable creation of robust and sustainable physical-activity habits. In addition, the application will adapt its functioning for ech patient over time in order to minimize user burden while optimizing its ability to encourage physical activity and maintain engagement with the intervention. A user-centered design process will be used to investigate design requirements of mHealth technologies for long-term use, and the system will be evaluated in a year-long study with 60 patients with coronary artery disease who completed phase II cardiac rehabilitation. Study data will be analyzed to understand how the use of different components affect, over time, patients' physical activity levels, perceived burden, and engagement with the system. The project's innovations lie in grounding the proposed intervention in dual-process models of self-regulation, developing new algorithms to enable adaptation and personalization of how the application works over time, and using a micro-randomization study design to enable causal accounts of how the application use affects patients' physical activity, user burden, and engagement over the course of a year. The success of the project will provide cardiac patients with continuously available support for staying physically active in the midst of daily life, and deep understanding of technical and design requirements for behavior-change mHealth technologies for long-term use.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8797750,R01HL125440,R01HL125440-01,125440,,,2015,1,329,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
629,"Temporal dynamics of stress, sleep, and arousal in short-term risk for adolescent suicidal behavior","While other leading causes of death have seen significant declines, suicide rates in youth have increased. It is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and hospital encounters for suicide in this age group have doubled over the last decade. In 50 years of research, the field has focused almost exclusively on long- term risk for suicidal outcomes, with an average follow-up period of 10 years. Indeed, there has been only one study of short-term risk for suicidal behavior in adults and none in adolescents. This is notable because long- term risk factors tend to be poor predictors of short-term risk. Consequently, the current evidence base for healthcare providers' decisions in determining proximal risk and the corresponding appropriate clinical response is quite limited. The low base rate of suicidal behavior in adolescents is particularly challenging for studying short-term risk for this outcome, and this in large part accounts for the absence of research in this area. To overcome this difficulty, large samples drawn from high-risk populations are necessary. In the current proposal, we are uniquely positioned to address this difficulty. That is, we will leverage secondary data from one of our current studies of suicide risk in adolescent psychiatric inpatients by pooling these data with data collected on 200 new patients for a final sample of 400. Additionally, recent developments in ambulatory assessment technologies offer novel opportunities for elucidating the temporal dynamics of proximal suicidal risk, thereby addressing the elusive question of not only whether an individual is at risk for engaging in suicidal behavior in the near future but when they may be most at risk. The current application will evaluate arousal (in the form of stress and sleep disturbance) in relation to proximal risk for suicidal outcomes using ambulatory assessment measures. Specifically, employing ecological momentary assessment, a mobile biosensor, and actigraphy, we aim to evaluate the interrelation of time-varying stress (at psychosocial and physiological levels) and sleep irregularity in the temporal dynamics of risk for suicidal ideation and events (suicide attempts and intensive clinical care for acute suicidality) over one month post-discharge. Given the prefrontal cortex's involvement in regulating arousal, we will also evaluate whether executive functioning at baseline moderates the effects of time-varying stress and sleep irregularity on proximal risk for these suicidal outcomes. Finally, we will supplement traditional statistical methods with novel advances in computational psychiatry. This proposal is innovative by being uniquely powered statistically to clarify the temporal dynamics of proximal risk for suicidal events, and leveraging new technologies to combine multiple methods (i.e., behavioral, physiological, neurocognitive, and self-report measures), including three continuous streams of ambulatory assessment data, across multiple units of analysis (i.e., psychosocial and physiological stress). This application may identify important variables for monitoring of patients during periods of elevated risk and identify specific and tractable treatment targets, thus providing directions for future clinical intervention efforts.",RF1,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9830385,RF1MH120830,RF1MH120830-01,120830,,,2019,1,315,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
630,Randomized trial of telehealth group intervention to reduce perinatal depressive symptoms in diverse populations,"Perinatal depression (PD) affects 12-15% of women and contributes to adverse outcomes, e.g. preterm birth, low birth weight, and impaired cognitive development of the child. Screening optimizes the detection of PD, but does not reduce barriers to mental health services (MHS) encountered by women who screen positive. A known shortage of MHS across the nation is a significant barrier, particularly in low resource and rural settings. Telehealth is a promising approach to reducing barriers, but there is little research on the effectiveness of telehealth to reduce perinatal depressive symptoms (PDS). There is high potential for telehealth to deliver effective, lower cost MHS to childbearing women, particularly those in low resource settings. The proposed project is a randomized controlled trial among women with mild to moderate PDS. The project aims to evaluate; 1) the effectiveness of a group mental health videoconference intervention (VCI) to reduce PDS across pregnancy and postpartum, and (2) differences in PDS between diverse groups of childbearing women: rural and urban-dwelling, and Hispanic and predominantly North European Descent (NED) populations. We hypothesize that women participating in the VCI will have significantly lower PDS across pregnancy and postpartum than women in an equivalent attention control (AC) group, and the results will differ between diverse groups. A total of 192 women will be enrolled; 48 in each study group. Participants are randomly assigned to study groups: VCI + standard of care, or AC + standard of care. Sessions are delivered via Utah Telehealth Network (UTN). Women in both groups attend weekly one-hour group sessions for 8 weeks using any electronic device (laptop, tablet, smart phone) from their own home. PDS is measured at 3 time points in pregnancy and 3 time points in postpartum. Our study is the first to use a VCI to engage women in a facilitated group approach to reducing PDS, and to evaluate the impact among diverse groups. The approach is cost effective and reduces barriers to access to MHS, particularly for women living in low-resource, and minority communities, and those without adequate transportation, childcare, or work release time. The VCI can be replicated in any setting (e.g. rural or urban), and can be adapted to the needs of diverse communities. The study advances the field by establishing whether a group telehealth intervention reduces PDS, and whether this differs based on the population. If effective and implemented broadly, far fewer women and families would suffer the negative consequences of depression.

638,"Circadian phase, sleep, and challenging behavior in autism spectrum disorder","Up to 2/3 of youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit challenging and often dangerous behaviors, including aggression and self-injury, that profoundly limits their access to community, educational, and therapeutic resources. Risk for challenging behavior and its consequences (e.g., psychiatric hospitalization; polypharmacy) increases during adolescence, particularly for severely affected youth with ASD (SA-ASD; characterized by intellectual disability or minimal verbal ability). Identifying contributors to challenging behaviors that can be modified using non-pharmacological and non-invasive approaches is a high priority for clinicians, researchers, and family caregivers. Yet, SA-ASD youth are under-represented in research, which restricts the potential for improvements for those who need it most. Sleep and the circadian regulation of sleep are modifiable through behavioral and chronotherapeutic interventions. In typically developing youth, the homeostatic and circadian regulation of sleep exhibits marked changes during adolescence (e.g., circadian phase delay). These changes confer risk for sleep problems and challenging behaviors mediated in part by changes in alertness, mood, and cognition. The proposed cross-sectional mentored study (K99) will evaluate if circadian phase delay is associated with sleep problems and challenging behaviors in SA-ASD youth. The study will be conducted in an inpatient psychiatric unit to facilitate training with, and enrollment of, SA-ASD youth, a population that is difficult to study in the community. The study will serve as a platform for training in (1) supportive techniques and non-invasive sleep measurement methods to increase participation of SA-ASD youth in objective sleep and circadian science, (2) systematic coding of observed challenging behavior and ecological momentary assessment methodology, (3) advanced analytic methods to model prospective associations and individual differences, and (4) the process of intervention development to support future intervention research. Training and lessons learned during the mentored phase will inform and support an independent prospective study (R00) of associations between circadian phase, sleep, and challenging behaviors in an independent sample of SA-ASD adolescents. The proposed study will follow SA-ASD youth as they are discharged from a psychiatric inpatient facility and return home. Following a pre-discharge baseline assessment in the hospital, in-home assessments of circadian phase and sleep and ecological momentary assessments of challenging behavior will be conducted at 6 and 12 months post-discharge. The objective of this study is to determine if circadian phase delay precedes the emergence/escalation of sleep problems and challenging behavior. This work will set the foundation for future studies to compare prospective associations between circadian phase, sleep, and challenging behavior across multiple comparison groups (e.g., higher- functioning ASD and typical development) and evaluate the clinical utility of intervening upon circadian phase to improve sleep and challenging behavior in ASD youth.",K99,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10039811,K99HD102586,K99HD102586-01,102586,,,2020,1,338,Tom,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
641,Smart Steps: A context-aware adherence intervention to improve PrEP adherence among men who have sex with men (MSM) with substance use disorder,"Adherence to once daily tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is nearly 99% effective in preventing HIV infection yet adherence remains challenging especially among men who have sex with men (MSM) with substance use disorder (SUD). MSM continue to experience disproportionate risk of HIV; 10% of new HIV infections in the United States in 2018 were among MSM. Substance use is a significant comorbidity and risk factor for HIV infection due to increased risky sexual activity, needle sharing, disorganized routines and difficulty learning adherence skills. Among MSM with SUD, measuring adherence remains critical to understanding methods in which to support PrEP adherence among at risk individuals. A digital pill system (DPS) comprising an ingestible radiofrequency emitter integrated into a gelatin capsule which overencapsulates PrEP can provide direct confirmation of PrEP ingestion events. The context in which these events occur can provide important insights into the etiology of nonadherence and challenges that may be addressed through personalized behavioral interventions. Our current work has demonstrated that MSM with SUD will accept and operate the DPS to measure PrEP adherence and are willing to accept interventions that account for patterns of PrEP ingestion from the digital pill. This Avenir Award takes a high risk, yet high reward advance by developing SmartSteps, a context aware, antecedent intervention that digests PrEP adherence data from the digital pill, combines it with digital phenotyping to anticipate potential PrEP nonadherence. In the face of anticipated nonadherence SmartSteps will deliver empiric corrective feedback thereby mitigating PrEP nonadherence before it occurs. This proposal will consist of two phases. In phase I, we will inform the specification of an algorithm that utilizes smartphone digital phenotyping features (location, Bluetooth, charging, accelerometry, app usage, phone and text usage) to anticipate PrEP nonadherence annotated by the digital pill. We will utilize a digital phenotyping app, Beiwe, which securely and anonymously collects raw smartphone use data. We will recruit N=40 MSM with substance use to utilize the digital pill for PrEP adherence in concert with Beiwe over 60 days to generate a dataset that will be used to train the algorithm behind SmartSteps. In phase II, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of SmartSteps compared to treatment as usual among HIV negative MSM with substance use disorder with a primary outcome of understanding the potential for an effect of SmartSteps in mitigating nonadherence and improving both overall and weekly adherence. The overall impact of this proposal will be to develop a context aware, anticipatory intervention that advances the science of adherence interventions in HIV prevention and SUD. SmartSteps will also serve as an architectural framework to inform the development of similar interventions that anticipate nonadherence in other chronic diseases.",DP2,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10468388,DP2DA056107,DP2DA056107-01,56107,,,2022,1,321,,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
664,Ultrafine Particulate Monitor for Personal Exposure Assessment,"Exposure to particulate air pollutants is associated with cardiovascular disease, asthma, lung cancer, and other illnesses. In the United States the CDC estimates that asthma costs $20 billion annually in medical care, lost workdays, and early deaths. However, due to the complexity of the environmental exposure mechanisms, there remains a degree of uncertainty concerning disease etiology. Wearable and highly-sensitive particulate sensors could help further elucidate the linkages between disease and particulate exposure. In this Small Business Innovation Research Phase 2 project Aerodyne Microsystems Inc. (AMI) will investigate the feasibility of a miniaturized, battery-powered, and inexpensive sensor for real-time monitoring of exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) from 2.5 um to ultrafine. The system employs the thermophoretic deposition of particulates from a sample air stream onto a thin-film bulk acoustic wave resonator (FBAR), and determines the PM mass deposited by measuring the frequency shift of oscillation. Incorporation of micromachined-electromechanical-system (MEMS) technologies allows unprecedented reduction in power consumption, cost, sample flow rate, and size. The research plan is to develop and experimentally demonstrate a new method for generation of air flow in the device, demonstrate sensor operation across a wide range of harsh, real-world operating conditions, and realize a new technique for aerosol sampling and handling that improves the sensor level of detection. The successful outcome of the project would culminate in a low-cost analytical instrument that provides real-time mass concentration of particles in a compact, wearable form factor. The monitor would be suitable for quantification of personal exposure to a range of environmental pollutants such as automotive exhaust, wood smoke, and nanoparticles.

673,Impact of Sleep Duration on Immune Balance in Urban Children with Asthma,"Urban children with asthma are at high risk for short sleep, due to an environment that jeopardizes sleep and asthma management. Further, this group suffers from altered immune balance, a key biological process contributing to individual differences in asthma morbidity and sleep health. Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder driven primarily by disturbed T helper 1 (Th1)/ 2 (Th2) cytokine balance marked by Th2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-5 and/or IL-13) predominance. Experimental findings in healthy adults show that shortened sleep increases inflammatory cytokine (e.g., IL-6) and certain Th2 cytokine levels and that recovery sleep following sleep restriction promotes a return to immune balance. Whether sleep duration plays a key role in immune function and associated asthma activity in urban children with asthma remains a scientific gap. We will use an experimental design that targets sleep duration, because (1) the urban environment and asthma symptoms interact to shorten sleep, (2) sleep duration is a modifiable behavior overlooked in clinical care of urban children with asthma, and (3) experimental data are critical to test a causal link for sleep duration as a mechanism underlying immune balance and asthma. We will enroll urban children (N=204; ages 8-9 years) with persistent allergic asthma and adequate sleep duration (9-11 h) who will complete a 4-week within-subjects protocol that includes 3 scheduled experimental sleep conditions: (1) 1 week stabilized sleep (individualized; 9-11 h time in bed), (2) 1 week shortened sleep (1.5 h decrease in time in bed), and (3) 2 weeks recovery sleep (1.5 h increase in time in bed). We will monitor sleep duration (actigraphy) and lung function (home spirometry) daily and assess immune biomarkers weekly and at the midpoint of shortened sleep. To control time-in-study effects, 1/3 of our sample will receive only the stabilized sleep schedule across the 4-week protocol. In this project, we will study only urban children with allergic asthma who obtain sufficient sleep (9-11 h, within national guidelines). Our shortened sleep protocol will model the sleep loss that urban children with asthma can experience due to asthma and/or urban context. Additionally, our recovery sleep protocol simulates a sleep optimization intervention following shortened sleep in a well-controlled approach. The first aim of the study is to examine the effects of shortened sleep on immune balance [e.g., Th1 (Interferon-IFNγ)/Th2 (Interleukin-IL-4, IL-5, IL-13)R and plasma IL-6 levels]. The second aim involves determining the effects of recovery sleep on immune balance. The third aim involves examining the extent to which changes in immune balance are associated with changes in asthma-related lung function (changes in FEV1) under conditions of shortened and recovery sleep. Results from this study ultimately will support the development feasible, ecologically valid, and clinically meaningful interventions to optimize sleep duration, immune balance, and asthma in this at-risk group.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10311771,R01HL156277,R01HL156277-01A1,156277,A1,,2021,1,337,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

However, little is known though about the effectiveness of RPM in healthcare delivery settings, or in medically underserved populations. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought to the fore the important role that RPM can play in ensuring continuity of care. It also has illustrated the limited infrastructural preparedness of community health centers, which provide care to the most medically underserved patients in the U.S., to provide RPM tools. The proposed study will evaluate the implementation of RPM tools to community health centers for patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes during the Covid-19 pandemic. The goal of this study is to evaluate the biomedical effects of these RPM interventions, and to gain insights into barriers and facilitators to implementation and adoption of the programs.

712,First-in-Human Use of an Artificial Lung for Ambulatory Respiratory Support,"Acute and chronic end stage lung disease (ESLD) are increasing healthcare problems. Currently, when mechanical ventilation fails only extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) systems with components designed and qualified for a few hours are available. These are often associated with serious complications and generally are restricted to bedside use. Like the further evolved field of mechanical circulatory support in response to refractory heart failure, a wearable, biocompatible integrated pump-lung would offer significant advantages to patients over existing options. Such a device might would pose a prolonged ambulatory platform for natural lung healing from acute injury, a bridge to transplant or destination therapy, or for novel lung regenerative therapies. With support from the NHLBI, we have made remarkable progress in development of a novel artificial pump-lung (APL) device for ambulatory respiratory support. The technology is near ready to be translated to the clinics for human use The goal of this translational research is to complete development of the advanced prototypical pump lung (APL) for ambulatory use in a first-in-human (FIM) trial. The APL will be joined with cannulae and a portable driver consisting of electronics, battery and oxygen source as an artificial pump lung system (APLS). The APLS will undergo preclinical validation and testing per FDA guidelines to receive an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). Four specific aims of the proposal are: (1) to complete development of the preclinical APLS, including the APL, cannulae, diagnostic sensors and a portable driver, and develop enabling technologies; (2) to develop processes and tools for manufacturing clinical grade APLS; (3) to qualify the APLS for clinical use in an FDA approved first-in-human study; and (4) to conduct a First-in-Human trial of the APLS to measure effect of treatment, basic safety and human response factors. The successful completion of these specific aims should result in a keystone respiratory support system that will, like the introduction of ventricular assst devices (VAD) for heart failure 20 years earlier, be a new therapeutic option for those with morbid, acute, and chronic pulmonary illnesses.

724,SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,"Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors.",K25,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9453227,K25DK113242,K25DK113242-01A1,113242,A1,,2018,1,382,Chris,,,,,,,,,
732,Longitudinal Adherence to Colorectal Cancer Screening in the VA,"AND ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. Despite overwhelming evidence that screening reduces both CRC incidence and mortality, less than two-thirds of eligible adults are up-to-date with screening. These figures also overestimate the proportion of Americans who receive adequate long-term protection from CRC because they are based on one-time, cross-sectional measurements. To ensure that eligible populations receive maximal benefit from CRC screening, it is critical to accurately measure adherence to different screening strategies over multiple cycles, to identify the various barriers to repeated screening, and to translate this information into effective interventions that can be implemented rapidly and efficiently. This K08 proposal will address the following three specific aims: (1) Quantify longitudinal adherence to screening colonoscopy and FOBT/FIT in the national VA database over a 15-year period; (2) Identify social and contextual barriers and facilitators to longitudinal adherence using a qualitative approach in veterans who are due for repeat screening/surveillance colonoscopy at an urban VA hospital; and (3) Assess the feasibility of a pilot bidirectional text messaging intervention on attendance for screening/surveillance colonoscopy and bowel preparation quality. This will be the first study to compare longitudinal adherence to screening colonoscopy and FOBT/FIT and one of the first to investigate the influence of text messaging on colonoscopy adherence.

749,CYCLE-AD: Randomized Controlled Trial to Assess the Efficacy of Indoor Cycling in Slowing Disease Progression in Healthy Older Persons at Genetic Risk for Alzheimer s Disease,"The apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE 4) allele is the most important genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent review by the World Health Organization highlighted the potential protective role of physical activity and exercise against cognitive decline, all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular dementia in healthy individuals. In an 18-month longitudinal observational study, we showed that sedentary 4 carriers experience significant declines in episodic memory and hippocampal volume compared to 4 carriers who engaged in moderate PA. Importantly, among 4 non-carriers, no significant longitudinal changes in cognition and brain imaging were observed whether the non-carriers were sedentary or engaged in moderate PA, suggesting that PA has a specific neuroprotective role in delaying the progression of AD in 4 carriers. Based on our results, a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial with blinded clinical and imaging outcomes is proposed to determine the impact of a home based, high intensity exercise intervention in healthy, cognitively intact 4 carriers between the ages of 65 and 80 years. The CYCLE-AD (CYcling to Cease or Limit the Effects of Alzheimer's Disease) trial will recruit otherwise healthy sedentary carriers randomized to one of two groups (n=75 each): 1) an Indoor Cycling (IC) group that participates in high-intensity interval training (HIIT; 60-90% of heart rate reserve) in their home via the commercially available Peloton® cycling system or 2) a Usual and Customary Care (UCC) group, in which participants engage in their habitual level of PA. We hypothesize that an 18-month high-intensity aerobic exercise regimen will slow AD-related disease progression in sedentary elders at genetic risk for AD. Participants in the intervention group will engage in exercise 3x/week (minimum 90 minutes/week) for 18 months. Primary outcome measures, obtained at study entry and at 18 months, will include comprehensive cognitive testing and brain MR imaging to assess disease progression and a comprehensive PA/fitness assessment to measure the degree of change in physical fitness due to high intensity aerobic exercise. The overall goal of the CYCLE-AD trial is to determine the role of long-term, high intensity exercise in slowing or delaying the onset of cognitive and AD-related brain changes in 4 carriers. Successful translation and demonstration of the effectiveness of a scalable home-based exercise intervention capable of slowing or delaying disease onset will transform AD treatment, improve patient outcomes and quality of life, and reduce health care costs.",R01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10111240,R01AG070736,R01AG070736-01,70736,,,2021,1,375,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
790,Mentoring in Community-engaged Research to Promote Health Equity for Latinos,"Dr. Page is an Associate Professor of Medicine and infectious disease specialist engaged in clinical care, and public health research with a focus on expanding access to care for marginalized populations through community-engaged program building and evaluation. Over the last 15 years, her research has focused on: 1) Elucidating the impact on health of stressors associated with migration and poverty; 2) Implementing and evaluating culturally and linguistically adapted interventions to improve access to care and utilization among underserved populations; and 3) Bridging the gap between scientific advances and real-world implementation to reach communities at highest risk of disease. She is the co-founder of Centro SOL (Center for Salud & Opportunities for Latinos), and has established a community coalition that has developed culturally and linguistically appropriate interventions to reduce health disparities among low-income limited Englih proficiency Latino communities. The objectives of this application are to support a program for mentoring junior investigators interested in health disparities, and to foster innovative epidemiology and implementation science research through interdisciplinary and community-engaged approaches. The research strategy proposed in this award capitalizes on existing multi-stakeholder community-academic-public health partnerships, as well as the infrastructure of Centro SOL and multiple independently funded research studies. This Mid-Career award explores the multi-level barriers and facilitators of engagement in healthcare and research through peers and technology (hybrid methods) that leverage social networks, mobile health (mHealth) and trusted community health workers. Informed by the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model (IMB) and Social Network Theory, Aim 1 will determine the efficiency and acceptability of hybrid methods to promote healthcare engagement among low income LEP Latinos. In Aim 2, the study will determine the efficiency and acceptability of using hybrid methods for recruitment, data collection, and research engagement among Latinos by comparing traditional convenience sampling approaches to sampling using technology-based methods. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Research Effectiveness-Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with key stakeholders to assess and inform implementation determinants and outcomes of hybrid methods to inform future broad scale implementation (Aim 3). This proposal creates a platform for trainees to learn and apply skills in community-based research, implementation science, mHealth, network analysis, epidemiology, and health disparities. This work also seeks to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in research by prioritizing community engagement and training opportunities for early-stage investigators who are under-represented in medicine and health-related sciences",K24,NR,NINR,NR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10506457,K24NR020508,K24NR020508-01,20508,,,2022,1,415,Tom,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
794,Patient-Centered Serious Games for Remote Cognitive Training in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,"Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is characterized by cognitive decline greater than expected from normal aging, which does not yet significantly interfere with the performance of activities of daily living. The therapeutic goal for MCI is to slow down the course of the disease progress and reduce the impact of clinical symptoms. There has also been a particular emphasis on non-pharmacological interventions because they can slow disease progression and are low cost, non-invasive, safe, and have no adverse side effects. Serious games have received great interests among researchers and clinicians as a promising, low-cost, non- pharmacological intervention tool that can help assess and train patients' cognitive function in a variety of environments (e.g., in/outside the clinic). Serious games in healthcare represent digital applications focusing on educating, informing, and enhancing patients' health by leveraging the entertainment components of video games. However, currently available solutions require substantial involvement of trained caregivers and clinicians to motivate patients to adhere to the intervention protocol, which acts as the key barrier to the widespread implementations of serious game-based interventions. To bridge these gaps, this project aims to develop a mobile-health (mHealth) technology designed to encourage the use of, and thereby maximizing the compliance to, serious game-based training in individuals with MCI outside the clinic. We plan to employ a tablet-based application - namely Neuro-World - composed of six serious games designed to stimulate working memory and selective attention, which is developed by our research team's industrial partner. Fully leveraging the system's ability to provide clinically meaningful insights related to patients' cognitive performance from their gameplays, their progress over time, and their compliance behaviors (e.g., use frequency and duration), it is our ultimate research goal to develop an optimal, human-centered serious game platform that can motivate patients' to better adhere to the technological regimen. To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on evaluating the preliminary efficacy of our serious games as a training tool to improve cognitive function. We will perform a small single-blind randomized controlled trial in 50 individuals with MCI who will be randomized either to the intervention group or the control group. In Aim 2, we will develop machine learning-based algorithms to derive clinically meaningful information regarding cognitive function from the game performance. Aim 3 will finally investigate the optimal design of the mHealth system to maximize patients' compliance with serious game-based training via human-centered design approaches. We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable self- administered, serious game-based cognitive training, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management.",R21,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10190616,R21AG071988,R21AG071988-01,71988,,,2021,1,417,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
801,"A Promotora-mediated, Family-based Intervention to Prevent Obesity in Latino Pres","Latino preschool children are more obese than preschool children in other racial/ethnic groups. Few family- based obesity interventions exist that target Latino preschool children and use culturally-appropriate measures and approaches. Latino peer health educators (promotoras) have been effective in increasing knowledge and promoting behavior change in Latino populations; however, to date, no promotora-led child obesity interventions targeting Latino preschool children exist. The purpose of the proposed research is to develop and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a family-based, promotora-mediated child obesity intervention. The proposed study will employ a mixed methods sequential research design, organized into two major phases: Phase I: Conduct language-stratified focus groups and cognitive interviews with Latino parents of preschool children to inform the development of a culturally-appropriate intervention and measures; Phase II: Test the feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention; Thirty Latino parents of children aed 2-5 years (Phase I) and fifty parent-child dyads (Phase II) will be recruited from Newberry and Saluda counties, South Carolina by six promotoras (females >18 years, active in community) from their own networks of churches, schools, neighborhoods, and corner stores. Promotoras will be recruited upon completion of the Promotores Initiative training program at the University of South Carolina and will receive an additional 20 hours of training using the intervention curriculum finalized after Phase I; promotoras will then deliver the home-based intervention to families over 10, 90-minute weekly sessions. The sessions, organized into education, practice and action (i.e., goal setting) components and inclusive of all family members who desire to attend, will educate and train parents to set feasible goals related to family diet, physical activty, and sedentary behavior to create supportive home environments to promote a healthy weight in their children. Primary outcomes (i.e., child body mass index [BMI] z-score and percentile) and secondary outcomes (e.g., child diet [food screener] and physical activity [accelerometry], the physical and social home environment [parent survey]) will be assessed pre- and post-intervention. Process evaluation will assess fidelity, dose, reach, recruitment, and contextual factors using multiple data sources and mixed methods. Descriptive analyses based on process data from promotoras, parents, and audio recordings will be used to determine intervention feasibility and level of implementation. Intervention impact on primary and secondary outcomes controlling for relevant variables will be assessed with ANCOVA in SAS. The proposed research carries high public health significance because it will influence specific behaviors in parents and children that have been associated with excessive weight gain. The research is innovative because it will be the first to use promotoras in a child obesity intervention for Latino preschool age children. If successful, this approach will be evaluated in a large-scale intervention and provide a potential model to help to address and prevent child obesity in Latino families.",R21,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8823611,R21HL119395,R21HL119395-03,119395,,,2015,3,401,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
806,A health monitoring tool for dementia care management,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias affect approximately 5.5 million patients in the U.S. 3 and is a leading cause of disability. Due to and poor coordination, families have no systematic plan to follow, leading to unnecessary hospitalizations, quicker transitions to a facility, caregiver burnout and high cost of care. We propose to demonstrate the feasibility for commercializing a highly validated, but resource intensive, dementia-specific care coordination program, the Maximizing Independence (MIND) at Home program developed at Johns Hopkins University. MIND at Home uses a care coordinator to 1) monitor and assess patient and caregiver needs; and deliver strategies and interventions. Through a randomized-clinical trial, the MIND at Home intervention has shown significant benefits, including delayed time to transition to long-term care facility, increased patient quality of life and reduced caregiver burden. Mind Halo has licensed the MIND at Home intervention and seeks to translate it into a commercial platform by addressing two challenges: scalability and cost. Currently MIND at Home requires in-person and on-site visits to assess and address changes in condition and does not efficiently leverage available health technology to provide cost- effective care. Through an extensive customer discovery process, we have additionally determined that continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) and home care organizations value and would be willing to purchase the program. We will develop, pilot, and evaluate a web and mobile platform for professional caregivers, working at CCRCs and family members. We will 1) develop a mobile/web application for professional caregivers to monitor and assess dementia patients and their family caregivers, and 2) develop and test a workflow tool for strategy and intervention delivery by a remotely-based care support team. Finally, we will 3) pilot and evaluate this platform for feasibility within a clinical trial run at a partner CCRC. Our test of feasibility will be the 1) demonstration of clinical relevance and clinical benefit of the web and mobile application and 2) demonstration of cost-effective care delivery.",R43,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9621317,R43AG060795,R43AG060795-01,60795,,,2018,1,423,Tom,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
826,Remedy to Diabetes Distress (R2D2): A Scalable Screen to Treat Program for School-Age Families,"While ~25% of school-age children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) achieve an HbA1c of <7.5%, the majority of school-age children do not and are at a higher risk for T1D-related complications. Achieving optimal T1D self- care is currently the only direct pathway to better HbA1c and even with the addition of modern therapeutic modalities (e.g., hybrid closed loop), T1D self-care is a complex, time-consuming, and relentless task. School- age children need support from their parents to effectively manage T1D and therefore both parents and youth with T1D are vulnerable to Diabetes Distress (DD). Presently, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care recommend assessment of DD during routine diabetes clinic visits in youth and their caregivers starting when youth are ~8-years-old. Unfortunately, while DD screening may be an ADA Care Standard, there are no practical and evidence-based screen-to-treat programs for clinics to adopt to meet this Standard of Care. We submit this new R01 in response to RFA-DK-19-021, Treating Diabetes Distress to Improve Glycemic Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes. Our objective is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, practical, and scalable screen-to-treat program for DD in school-age children and their parents (called Remedy to Diabetes Distress [R2D2]) and to test the initial efficacy of R2D2 to reduce DD to improve children's glycemic control. Our specific aims are: 1) Define and iteratively refine our new screen-to-treat program (R2D2) for DD in school-age families in order to maximize feasibility and acceptability to stakeholders, and 2) Establish initial efficacy of R2D2 to reduce parent and child DD to improve child glycemic control. To enhance scientific rigor, we will use the ORBIT Model for Behavioral Intervention Development to guide our study design. The ORBIT Model proposes a phased approach using a series of small, cost-effective studies to determine clinically- meaningful targets and to test a treatment's acceptability and initial efficacy before embarking on a large clinical trial. For ORBIT Phase 1a: Define, we will conduct a brief longitudinal study to establish cut-points for clinically relevant DD in parents and school-age children, engage clinic Quality Improvement teams to develop a practical clinic-based screening approach, and use crowdsourcing techniques to obtain family input on a new mHealth treatment. For ORBIT Phase 1b: Refine, we will test implementation of our R2D2 screening program across multiple clinics and we will conduct a small trial to identify an initially efficacious and practical mHealth treatment delivery approach for R2D2. Finally, for ORBIT Phase 2a, we will continue to screen for DD in clinic and recruit families who report clinically relevant DD into a Proof of Concept Pilot to examine whether ameliorating parent and/or child DD leads to improved child glycemic control. We believe our study optimally responds to the FOA because our: 1-research team is multidisciplinary and includes a true partnership between a behavioral scientist and a diabetologist, 2-R2D2 screen-to-treat program reflects a practical approach that could realistically occur in clinic, 3-use of Implementation Science will further enhance future sustainability and dissemination of R2D2.",R01,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10133881,R01DK127493,R01DK127493-01,127493,,,2020,1,434,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
831,Healthy Sleep Intervention for Preschool Children,"Behavioral sleep problems such as sleep onset difficulties, night waking, and inadequate duration affect 25-40% of 2.5 to 5 year-old children. Here, we propose a randomized controlled trial and longitudinal follow- up of a health behavior change intervention that aims to give parents knowledge and skills, and motivate them to set goals, problem-solve, and improve their child's sleep. Previous interventions have largely focused on a single aspect of sleep (such as bedtime resistance) and utilized a single tactic (such as graduated extinction). Despite the availability of these strategies, parents often struggle to address their child's sleep problems, which may stem from multiple factors including an inconsistent bedtime, a bedtime routine that is a poor match for the child's temperament, variable parental responses to child behavior, and social and environmental barriers. As a result parents may need to be coached in how to make multiple changes in bedtime behaviors, and without active support, may give up on worthwhile changes before reaching the tipping point where positive outcomes are seen. To better address the multifactorial nature of early childhood sleep problems, the successfully pilot-tested SHIP (Sleep Health in Preschoolers) intervention offers parents education and tools utilizing evidence-based strategies. Short-term consequences of sleep problems in young children include behavior problems and parental stress and sleep loss. In the long-term, observational studies have associated early childhood sleep problems with obesity, mental illness, and poor academic achievement. Causal evidence regarding these long-term effects can provide the motivation and evidence needed to make early childhood sleep a public health priority. Using an innovative and multi-faceted approach to child sleep, we will leverage the experimental nature of a RCT design to test the causality of the relationship between early childhood sleep problems and subsequent obesity, emotional and behavior problems, and poor academic achievement. While understanding the long-term outcomes of poor sleep in early childhood is vital to improving health, even acute behavior problems and parental sleep loss highlight the need for effective and accessible interventions. As such, our specific aims are as follows: 1. to test if the SHIP program can significantly improve sleep in intervention preschool children as compared to active controls, both following intervention and at follow-up. 2. To test whether intervention for early childhood sleep problems leads to decreased long-term squeal (excess weight gain, emotional and behavioral problems, and poor school achievement) in the intervention group as compared to active controls. 3. To explore how intervention in early childhood affects the trajectory of sleep problems and family response to re-emergent sleep problems over 3 years. Achieving these aims has the dual potential to improve child sleep and expand our scientific understanding of how early childhood sleep problems affect development.",R01,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8782627,R01HD071937,R01HD071937-02,71937,,,2015,2,416,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
832,Improving Rural Access to Pediatric Healthcare with Accurate Telehealth Diagnosis of Acute Otitis Media using Smartphone Acoustic Reflectometry,"Acute otitis media (AOM) is a leading cause of pediatric visits each year, affecting 85% of children under the age of 3. There are 18 million annual doctor visits due to suspected AOM, which today are challenging to conduct over telehealth because diagnosis traditionally requires an in-person physical exam. This is particularly problematic for rural children who can't easily access healthcare services leading to possible complications from under-treatment (hearing loss, speech delay, eardrum perforation). Current telehealth services lack technology to successfully conduct a middle ear fluid exam, the key finding of the physical exam for an AOM. Wavely Diagnostics is developing a smartphone-based tool for lay users that accurately detects middle ear fluid during a telehealth visit. Our technology uses acoustic reflectometry-an impedance-based technique that reflects sound chirps off the eardrum-paired with machine learning algorithms to determine middle ear fluid status. In this Direct to Phase II SBIR project, the specific aims are: 1) develop an in-field calibration process to drive compatibility across smartphones, 2) clinically demonstrate accuracy of middle ear fluid detection with device as compared to physician assessment, 3) develop a HIPAA-compliant Wavely Application Programing Interface (API) to integrate with a telemedicine platform, and 4) validate the clinical utility of Wavely Middle Ear Fluid Scanner for diagnosing AOM in a telemedicine setting. The expected outcome of this proposal is a Middle Ear Fluid Scanner for AOM detection that will be ready for widescale use by telehealth services supporting rural populations. Given the ubiquity of smartphones across all communities, recent rise in telehealth usage particularly in rural communities where significant investment is being made in broadband services, and the critical need for accurate remote diagnostics, our proposed system has the potential to significantly improve healthcare access for the 13.4 million children in rural communities.",R44,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10600672,R44MD018225,R44MD018225-01,18225,,,2022,1,437,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
836,DiSCERN: Advanced PD Therapy Candidacy and Evaluation System,"The objective is to design, develop, and clinically assess DiSCERN, a standardized telemedicine tool for identifying patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who would benefit from advanced therapies (AT) and determining when AT recipients need therapy adjustments. Once chronic PD medication usage results in motor fluctuations and dyskinesias and all non-invasive therapies have been exhausted, AT (e.g., deep brain stimulation, drug pumps) is often recommended. While experts at academic medical centers may appropriately identify AT candidates, AT is underutilized due to limited access and inequitable utilization of limited evaluative resources for a sizable subset of the PD population. Remote screening and monitoring with DiSCERN will improve patient selection, reduce disparities, and expand access for rural populations and disadvantaged communities. The system will engage and empower patients, providers, and healthcare institutions and lead to improved health, healthcare delivery, and the reduction of health disparities. This mobile health technology will include a patient friendly smartphone app, non-motor assessments, and wireless wearable sensors for continuously monitoring PD motor symptoms, complications, and quality of life (QoL). We have previously commercialized wearables and mobile apps for remote monitoring of PD motor symptoms and side effects, which will significantly de-risk the project. Still, novel development and validation efforts are required to commercialize this new technology. Innovations include: 1) integration of PD monitoring algorithms with context aware activity detection for improved PD motor assessment and QoL quantification; 2) implementation of the algorithms on a smartphone and wearable device; 3) development of a predictive model that uses motor and non-motor features to accurately identify PD patients who would be good candidates for AT; and 4) implementation of a model that alerts clinicians when an AT recipient needs a therapy adjustment. Through integration with AT systems, DiSCERN will improve the clinician experience and allow the limited availability of specialists to scale care to a diverse and growing PD population, who may not otherwise have access to AT. Phase I includes: 1) validation of context aware activity detection algorithms on PD patient data; 2) determining the extent specific activities or activity levels correlate with PD QoL; 3) using clinician feedback to identify collected data features that are useful in informing AT clinical decisions; and 4) identification of wearables to be used in the final system. Phase II includes: 1) transition of context aware activity detection and PD symptom quantification algorithms onto a smartphone and wearable chips; 2) development of a smartphone app that integrates data collection, non-motor assessment, and data-transfer to the cloud; and 3) collecting data from AT candidates in the months before and after AT is initiated to develop models that accurately identify AT candidates and when AT adjustments are needed. DiSCERN will improve therapy efficiency, expand access, and result in more patients opting for AT.",R44,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9685393,R44MD013767,R44MD013767-01,13767,,,2018,1,439,Josh,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
852,Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,"In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our team's expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally.

874,"A patient self-assessment software combining compliance protocols to improve prescriber confidence, reduce liability, and improve patient outcomes.","The current overdose epidemic is being fueled by widespread, non-medical use of opioids prescribed by mostly well-meaning physicians with inadequate training on how to properly initiate, monitor and discontinue opioid therapy. Many patients being initiated on chronic opioid therapy have factors putting them at higher risk for substance misuse and possible future overdose, however the typical primary care visit for a new patient is too short for a thorough evaluation. This puts patients at risk by perpetuating a substandard level of care, and puts prescribers at risk by lacking substantiated documentation to support the legal standard ""legitimate medical purpose"". Most current measures aimed at solving the opioid epidemic have not considered the biggest obstacle to appropriate patient care and good medicolegal documentation, which is time. To complicate the matter, many physicians are simply refusing to prescribe opioids for fear of criminal, civil or regulatory intervention. This is compounding the issue by inundating clinics that do prescribe opioids with new, unverified patients that are often almost out of medication or already in withdrawal. This common scenario is contributing to the steady rise of fentanyl and other synthetic opioid related overdose deaths by pushing patients with pain, dependence and addiction to seek help through illegal means. The Care Continuity Program (CCP), a product of Sure Med Compliance, is a novel, online patient self-assessment used by prescribers of opioids to better identify patient risk factors and therapy benefit. This tool is completed by the patient, outside of the office, using an internet enabled device and follows a compliance driven protocol developed by analyzing case law against physicians in mis-prescribing opioid cases. Results, in the form of a date and time stamped legal report, are instantly transmitted to the prescriber's electronic health records, mitigating the prescriber's civil and criminal risk. A brief of findings is displayed within the software through a dashboard and on the summary page of the report. This software offering includes a mobile and standard web-based application. The objective of the proposed research is to validate the protocols and delivery system of the CCP by measuring patient outcomes, prescriber confidence, and completeness of documentation in the patient chart in primary care and pain management settings, pre and post implementation of the CCP.",R44,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10013399,R44DA051272,R44DA051272-01,51272,,,2020,1,458,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
880,Imaging Goggles for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery,"Interest in the use of optical imaging instruments in medical interventions stems from their ease of use, rapid adaptation to clinical needs, portability, real-time feedback, and relatively low cost. Of particular interest is the role of optical imaging in oncology. Surgery is the primary curative method for solid tumors confined to the tissue of origin with the goal of completely removing both the tumor mass and microscopic lesions. Unfortunately, the irregular growth pattern and infiltrations into surrounding healthy tissue prevent complete removal in many cases, resulting in positive surgical margins (PSMs). PSMs are prevalent in oncologic surgery, increasing cancer recurrence rates and often necessitates a second surgery to improve disease-specific survival. While PSM occurrence is significant in advanced clinical centers, the situation is worse in many rural hospitals and resource- limited areas due to limited histology infrastructure and workforce needed for margin assessment. Thus there is an urgent need for an intraoperative imaging system to visualize cancer, guide tumor removal, and determine margin positivity in the operating room (OR) in low and high resource settings alike. Handheld fluorescence imaging systems have been developed to aid cancer resection. Still, they suffer from several limitations, including a significant footprint in the OR and the inability of the operating surgeon to directly control the imaging device while performing surgery. To address these shortcomings, we developed a head- mounted display device (HMD) cancer imaging system for real-time intraoperative fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS). The system HMD captures near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and color images from the surgical bed and displays accurately aligned color-NIR images in real-time, enabling FGS without disrupting surgical workflow. The HMD has a small footprint, is intuitive to use, and is amenable for widespread use, including non-cancer applications such as imaging of peripheral blood flow. Preliminary testing of the HMD system in human cancer patients identified some areas for improvement that will accelerate the eventual clinical adoption of the system worldwide. Addressing these needs requires expertise in packaging software development for medical devices with DICOM image format and user interface development using human factors engineering. We have teamed up with a company that has both expertise and experience in developing augmented reality/mixed reality (AR/VR) software combined with deep machine learning in wearable devices on this project. Together, we will optimize the system performance and ergonomics using human factors engineering. The collaborative project will (1) develop and validate an automated fluorescence thresholding algorithm for tumor delineation; (2) develop and validate automated registration of augmented reality in the system; and (3) develop and evaluate clinical software to improve user experience. At the completion of this project, we expect to develop and validate a clinic-ready, user-friendly HMD system with a small hardware footprint, enabling seamless integration with surgical workflow to enhance clinical adoption. The system will increase the rates and decrease the time of successful tumor resection. Anticipated low cost and ease of use will expand adoption in low and high resource settings worldwide.

A number of different sleep parameters have also been closely tied to memory consolidation and chronic sleep disruption increases the risk of memory impairment in older individuals. However, despite data linking sleep disruption to Alzheimer's disease pathology and memory impairment, significant gaps remain in our understanding of how sleep disruption evolves over the course of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and what aspects of sleep may be targets for intervention. In this context, we propose to directly examine the evolution of sleep disruption in relation to the in vivo progression of tau pathology, cognitive decline, and network dysfunction. Leveraging data that suggest that tau accumulation may be quite rapid during prodromal Alzheimer's disease, we will focus these studies on individuals with MCI. We hypothesize that disrupted sleep architecture will be closely related to increased neocortical tau pathology and cognitive impairment, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Further, we hypothesize that sleep disruption leads to diminished connectivity in brain networks previously linked to memory performance and cognitive decline, and that this network dysregulation may partially mediate the effects of sleep disruption on cognition. Together, these studies will improve understanding on mechanistic links between sleep, cognition, and Alzheimer's disease. More broadly, the data from these studies will critically inform the design of interventional studies modifying sleep in early Alzheimer's disease by identifying which specific aspects of disrupted sleep are most closely tied to b-amyloid and tau pathology (potential therapeutic targets), assessing which aspects of sleep change over time in MCI, and the extent to which longitudinal polysomnography and actigraphy can measure aspects of sleep disruption relevant to Alzheimer's disease.",R01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9836083,R01AG062667,R01AG062667-01A1,62667,A1,,2019,1,448,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
896,Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,"Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in ""real time"", allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine.",R01,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9643493,R01MH118274,R01MH118274-01,118274,,,2019,1,469,Audie,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
908,Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space,"The human brain tracks multiplexed signals during social interactions. The breakdown of any of these computations could lead to social deficits observed in many psychiatric disorders. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models. Importantly, previous social neuroscience research generally assumes that the structure of social environments are stochastic and social agents act in a reactive way, leaving at least two knowledge gaps in the literature: 1) the proactive nature of social agents and 2) the dynamic and multidimensional feature of social space. The overarching aim of this project is to develop novel computational models and paradigms to capture social controllability and social navigation in 'unselected' human participants (laboratory study n=100, mobile app n=10,000), which can ultimately be used to capture social failures across disorders. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel generative model and paradigm for social controllability, based on a rich literature on model-based decision-making and our previous work on social learning. Key subject-level parameters include: simulated controllability (delta), future thinking weight (i.e. weight put on planning future interactions), and learning rate (epsilon). In Aim 2, we will delineate navigational computations of dynamic social relationships using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters, we will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals' two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning to 1) deep phenotype participants along the dimensions of social controllability and navigation and 2) predict clinical and subclinical symptoms among a large sample of 'unfiltered' volunteers. Upon successful completion of these aims, this proof-of-concept project will provide important validation for new computational frameworks for social controllability and social navigation, potentially breaking new grounds for computational psychiatry research of social dysfunction. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of clinical disorders including psychotic, mood, and personality disorders. Furthermore, the proposed paradigms can be back-translatable to animal models, in relation to the social defeat model of depression and other animal models of social behaviors. Thus, the proposed computational framework could have far-reaching influences that would exceed the specific focus on social control and social space navigation, advancing the possibility to advance mechanistic understanding of and develop individualized diagnosis and treatments across multiple psychiatric disorders.",R21,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9827207,R21MH120789,R21MH120789-01,120789,,,2019,1,476,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
929,Building the Evidence Base for Physically Active Lessons in Elementary Schools,"Physical activity has long been recognized as an important component of cancer prevention. Given the precipitous drop in activity during childhood, preventing this reduction in activity is a key point of emphasis. To this end, children's non-discretionary time at school provides an ideal target of intervention, with physically active lessons identified as a useful strategy. Because teachers are asked to implement these interventions, we must know more about outcomes that are in-line with teacher motivation. As such, this proposal is designed to determine the impact of physically active lessons on in-school physical activity that occurs outside of recess and PE, along with both proximal (1 week) and distal (6 month) academic outcomes. To achieve these aims, 30 schools will be recruited in two waves and assigned to one of three groups: (1) experimental, (2) sedentary control, or (3) active, unrelated content control. If successful, these data will do much to advance teacher motivation to implement this and similar physical activity interventions, which, in turn, will help children to amass the recommended 60 min of daily physical activity that has been tied to greater lifelong activity and cancer prevention.",R01,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8828265,R01HD070741,R01HD070741-05,70741,,,2015,5,465,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
970,Mind Your Walk Intervention for Community-Based Management of Knee OA: A Feasibility Study,"The overarching goal of this research is to develop an effective walking- based intervention that reduces disability and also maintains joint structure for people with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Walking disability leads to an increased risk of early death in people with knee OA. Furthermore, people with knee OA walk with movement patterns that overload the cartilage and may lead to rapid OA progression. Current gait retraining interventions use expensive devices, target a single joint, or focus on only reducing the knee adduction moment. Furthermore, these interventions may not address adherence, dissemination, and scalability, and may not utilize the ubiquity of mobile technology. This project proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative community based intervention (""Mind Your Walk"") that incorporates whole-body movement retraining based on biomechanical principles, along with mindful body-awareness skills, for people with knee OA. The goal is to use the results from this project to support the design of a larger randomized trial comparing this intervention with standard exercise programs. To achieve this goal, this project will focus on - 1) demonstrating feasibility of recruitment, adherence, and retention with the Mind Your Walk intervention, 2) quantifying the variability of biomechanical and functional outcomes, and 3) usability testing of a mobile health (mHealth) application for monitoring adherence and maintaining engagement for Mind Your Walk intervention. Subjects with radiographic and symptomatic knee OA (n=62) will participate in the feasibility study. Another group (n=10) will participate in usability testing of the mHealth application. The intervention will be delivered using community-based group sessions over 6-months. After that the subjects will practice on their own for another 6-months. The attention-matched control group will receive education on OA. In addition to feasibility data, knee loading during walking will be quantified using an EMG-Driven knee model and gait analyses at baseline and 6-months. Daily physical activity using accelerometers and self-reported pain will be recorded at baseline and every 3-months for a period of 1-year. The principal investigator (PI) has expertise in rehabilitation, biomechanics, and applications of quantitative imaging. The PI's long-term goal is to lead an inter-disciplinary translational musculoskeletal research program in OA; that is focused on unraveling the biomechanical pathways underlying OA, and using this knowledge to develop targeted interventions. This award will enable the applicant to gain additional training in all aspects of clinical trials and use of mHealth technologies in knee OA. Additional training will focus on advanced biostatistics for clinical trials and longitudinal data, and on leadership and team science. The mentoring team comprises of established senior scientists in rheumatology, clinical trials, mobile health technologies, and biostatistics. The PI has strong Institutional support, and this project will accelerate the PI's transition to an independent investigator, and enable collection of critical data for design of the clinical trial.",K01,AR,NIAMS,AR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9243375,K01AR069720,K01AR069720-01A1,69720,A1,,2017,1,507,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
973,Pain and Health-Related Quality of Life in Children after Surgery,"Over 4.5 million children undergo surgery in the U.S. each year and about half of them experience moderate- severe postsurgical pain. Pain may also persist beyond the immediate postsurgical period and transition into chronic pain for some children. However, little is known about the prevalence of persistent postsurgical pain in the pediatric surgery population or of the impact of pain on children's physical functioning, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and health service utilization. Understanding of the biopsychosocial factors that may predict a child's risk for experiencing persistent postsurgical pain and reduced HRQOL would address gaps in knowledge to allow for the future development of preventive interventions. The objective of this application is to document longitudinal trajectories of pain and HRQOL in children following surgery, and to identify individual differences that place children at risk for both acute and chronic postsurgical pain and deteriorations in HRQOL. The long-term goal of this research is to develop effective strategies to prevent persistent postsurgical pain in children. The K23 candidate is an assistant professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine at the University of Washington and a pediatric anesthesiologist and pain physician at Seattle Children's Hospital. Her K23 proposal will capitalize on the wealth of resources available at the University of Washington School of Medicine and Seattle Children's Research Institute. The candidate has demonstrated commitment to a patient-oriented research career and proposes a five-year training plan with the support of faculty mentors who have expertise in pediatric pain, health services outcomes research, pediatric research ethics, and biostatistics. Through the research training plan the candidate will obtain specialized instruction in state-of-the-art pain and functional outcomes assessment tools, intervention research methodology, preventive research and mentorship in research career development. The research plan involves two studies. Study 1 will prospectively monitor pain and HRQOL before and after surgery in a large hospital-based cohort of children undergoing minor and major surgical procedures over the first month post-hospital discharge. Study 2 will prospectively measure individual differences (clinical and biopsychosocial factors) associated with change in pain and function before and over 18 months following major surgery in a smaller, well-characterized sample using state-of-the art measurement tools including daily electronic diary monitoring and ambulatory actigraphy. Preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of the multi-method assessment plan in the perioperative and postoperative periods and ensure success in carrying out the proposed studies. Data generated from this research will be used to identify children at-risk for chronic postsurgical pain and impaired quality of life, an will guide later research to develop and test medical and behavioral interventions for at-risk youth. Completion of the proposed research and training plan will provide the candidate with necessary data and essential skills to develop into a successful independent pediatric pain researcher.",K23,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8916812,K23HD078239,K23HD078239-02,78239,,,2015,2,487,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
974,Mechanisms of Gait and Balance Impairment in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy,"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a fatal, progressive, incurable neurodegenerative tauopathy. Falls resulting from gait and balance impairments are a cardinal feature of the disease and occur in all PSP syndromes. Currently, detection of these abnormalities relies on largely subjective clinical examination and scales. There are no standardized ways to quantify specific features of gait and balance impairments in PSP. Diagnostic, and prognostic tests focusing on patient relevant outcomes such as gait related disability are needed. Motion analysis technology can be used for objective qualification of gait and balance variables. This offers an opportunity to develop patient-centric diagnostic tools that can measure features of gait impairment and its impact on risk for falls. Laboratory-based video motion capture utilizes multiple high frequency cameras in a well calibrated controlled environment to generate a three-dimensional model of human locomotion and balance. This is considered the most accurate and reliable method of motion analysis. Our project will utilize laboratory-based motion capture to identify gait metrics that best characterize PSP Richardson syndrome, PSP-cortical and PSP-subcortical syndromes and distinguish PSP from normal controls. However, accredited motion analysis labs are not readily accessible, and require an elaborate usually expensive set-up. Body-worn motion-sensing devices offer a feasible alternative. They are cost-effective, portable, easy to use in ambulatory settings. However, it is essential to establish reliability and accuracy of these devices in specific patient populations and assess clinical significance of the data captured. Therefore, in this project we will employ a body-worn motion sensing device or inertial monitoring unit (IMU) to detect gait and balance metrics that best characterize PSP. The data from the IMU will then be compared to the motion analysis lab to establish its accuracy. Gait metrics have the potential to serve as patient-centric outcome measures in PSP. In this project we will also use these variables to analyze neurobiological mechanisms underlying gait and balance impairment in PSP. We will correlate the identified gait and balance metrics with volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI) and tractography to determine patterns of disruption of cortical and subcortical motor control systems in PSP. The effect of sex as a biologically significant variable will be assessed. Age will be a covariate to identify gait abnormalities that are specifically related to disease state and not secondary to normal aging. The outcomes of this research project will contribute to development of patient centric outcome measures, assessment of clinical heterogeneity and understanding of mechanisms of gait impairment in PSP syndromes. Future directions will include longitudinal assessment and comparative analyses across related neurodegenerative diseases to advance diagnosis and development of patient centric outcome measures for clinical trials.",K23,NS,NINDS,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10522661,K23NS124688,K23NS124688-01A1,124688,A1,,2022,1,509,Audie,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
977,Families Improving Together (FIT) For Weight Loss,"The increasing rate of obesity has become a major public health concern with national reports indicating 40% of African American adolescents are now overweight or obese. Little is known about effective weight loss interventions in ethnic minority adolescents. In part, this is because research has shown that ethnic minorities attend fewer intervention sessions, have higher attrition rates and lose less weight compared to Caucasians. Two fundamental problems related to this lack of progress are 1) the lack of appropriate content of weight loss interventions for African American adolescents that integrate cultural issues, parenting skills, and motivational strategies for long-term change and, 2) the poor dose of weight loss interventions because of participant fatigue and drop out. Previous weight loss studies among adolescents have been of relatively long duration lasting 12-25 weeks, however, our team has developed a weight loss program that is a relatively brief (8-week brief) face-to-face intervention that integrates motivational (autonomy-support) and positive parenting skills (monitoring, social support, positive communication skills) for reducing z-BMI in overweight African American adolescents. Our team has also recently conducted a pilot study testing the feasibility of an 8-week on-line intervention that is culturally tailored fr African American families. Thus, the goal of this project is to conduct a randomized controlled efficacy trial to address the problems with past studies by 1) making the face-to-face group intervention shorter, 2) using an on-line component to compliment the group- based intervention for increasing dose, and by 3) tailoring a motivational and parenting skills program directly to parents and adolescents skill levels and cultural background. 520 overweight African American adolescents and their parents will be recruited to participate. Phase I of the trial will test the efficacy of an 8-week face-to-face group randomized trial comparing motivational plus family-based weight loss (M+FWL) to a basic health (BH) education program on reducing z-BMI and improving diet and physical activity (PA) in overweight African American adolescents. In phase II of the trial participants will be re-randomized to either an 8-week on-line intervention or a control on-line program resulting in a 2 (M+FWL vs. BH group) x 2 (intervention vs. control on-line program) factorial design. This design will allow us to test the effects of the M+FWL curriculum and the added effects of the on-line intervention component on reducing z-BMI in African American adolescents and their parents. A 6-month follow-up will examine whether adolescents in the 8-week M+FWL group plus 8-week on-line intervention program will show the greatest maintenance in reducing z- BMI. Psychosocial mediators of treatment effects will be examined as well as treatment effects related to parent changes in z-BMI and health behaviors (diet and PA).",R01,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8876750,R01HD072153,R01HD072153-04,72153,,,2015,4,489,,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
981,Prescribed Exercise to Reduce Recidivism After Weight Loss,"Clinically significant weight loss (5-10%) is associated with cardiovascular health benefits for obese adults, and participation in adequate amounts of physical activity is a critical factor for weight maintenance after weight loss. However, the recommended amount of physical activity needed to promote weight maintenance is based primarily on retrospective studies that quantified physical activity levels through questionnaires which tend to overestimate physical activity levels. In addition, the present literature has provided little data on impact of these physical activity levels on cardiovascular risk factors, which may have equal or more clinical importance compared to weight changes. The purpose of the Prescribed Exercise to Reduce Recidivism After Weight Loss (PREVAIL) study is to evaluate the effect aerobic exercise training amount on weight maintenance following clinically significant weight loss in obese men and women (BMI 35-45) ages 18-65 years old. Volunteers will complete an OPTIFAST weight loss program at VIDANT Wellness Nutrition Clinic. Individuals who achieve a weight loss of at least 7% from baseline weight will be subsequently randomized to levels of aerobic training approximately half of PA recommendations (B-REC), consistent with physical activity recommendations (PA- REC), or weight maintenance recommendations (WM-REC) for 9 additional months. Exercise sessions will be directly supervised by study staff. Non-exercise physical activity will be captured through accelerometry during the entire intervention in all randomization groups and total energy expenditure will be assessed by doubly labeled water (the gold standard technique). The primary outcome of the PREVAIL study will be change in weight from the completion of OPTIFAST program (achievement of clinically significant weight loss) to the end of exercise training. Main secondary measures include proportion of participants achieving weight maintenance, changes in clinically relevant cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g. fat mass, lipids, c-reactive protein, fitness and insulin sensitivity, pulsewave velocity, augmentation index and lipoprotein particle size, and changes in quality of life) between study groups.

988,Wearable silent speech technology to enhance impaired oral communication,"The long-term objectives of this project are to obtain a deeper understanding how articulatory movement patterns are mapped to speech particularly when there is no vocal fold vibration (silent speech) and then to develop a novel, wearable assistive technology called silent speech interface (SSI) to assist the impaired oral communication for individuals in need (e.g., individuals after laryngectomy, surgical removal of larynx to treat advanced laryngeal cancer). Designed for daily use, the SSI contains a wearable magnetic device and a small camera for tongue and lip motion tracking, respectively, and an articulation-to-speech synthesizer to output natural sounding speech that preserves the speaker's voice characteristics. Specific Aims of the proposal include to (1) determine the articulatory patterns of normal (vocalized) and silent speech, produced by both healthy talkers and people after laryngectomy, (2) develop a wearable, wireless magnetic device for real-time tongue and lip motion tracking, and (3) synthesize speech from articulation directly. There are currently limited alternative communication options for people who have undergone laryngectomy. These options include esophageal speech, tracheo-esophageal speech, and use of an artificial larynx (or electrolarynx). These solutions are either invasive or difficult to use, and all of them result in a hoarse or mechanical/robotic sounding voice, which can be difficult to understand. In contrast, the SSI in this application is non-invasive, easy-to-use, and produces natural sounding speech and may even preserve the patient's voice identity. We have exciting preliminary results that support the feasibility of the project including that (1) we have recently developed a wireless magnetic device for tongue motion, and (2) we have demonstrated real- time articulation-to-speech synthesis with a 90% word accuracy (judged by a human listener). In this project, we will further reduce the size of the wireless device and make it wearable and conduct articulation-to-speech algorithms by studying 30 participants after laryngectomy and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. If successful, the proposed research will enhance human health by making an impact on individuals after laryngectomy and potentially to a broader range of other speech and voice disorders. In addition, the technology will have an impact to the speech science field by providing a fist-time-ever tool for potential large- scale tongue motion data collection and have a variety of broader implications including visual feedback-based secondary language training and speech therapy, which may benefit millions of people with motor speech deficits in the United States.",R01,DC,NIDCD,DC,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9740858,R01DC016621,R01DC016621-01A1,16621,A1,,2019,1,518,Leonie,,,,,,,,,

We named this proposed center OPAL, after its goal of Optimizing and Personalizing interventions for people with schizophrenia Across the Lifespan. The goal of OPAL is to accelerate the adaptation, development and implementation of effective, personalized treatments in real-world settings. The specific aims of this center are as follows: 1. Create an infrastructure that supports research that tests innovative ways to optimize treatments for people with schizophrenia throughout the lifespan and that accelerates the translation of clinical research on schizophrenia to routine practice settings. 2. Conduct exploratory and pilot projects that develop, adapt, and test innovative methods to personalize treatments for schizophrenia and to make them effective and readily deployable. 3. Train scientists who will conduct translational research on services and treatments for persons with schizophrenia. The three OPAL developmental projects address important representative problems that affect people diagnosed with schizophrenia throughout the course of illness. Project 1 addresses cognitive impairments, which have been detected during the prodromal period until late life and are a key contributor to functional impairments. The project examines ways to personalize cognitive remediation and make it more accessible. The project will examine the feasibility of delivering cognitive remediation in non-clinic settings and baseline testing to tailor the intervention to individual needs. Project 2 addresses the treatment of common chronic medical conditions that are associated with considerable morbidity and premature mortality in schizophrenia. The project adapts Critical Time Intervention (CTI) to the needs of individuals with schizophrenia who are hospitalized for ambulatory care sensitive conditions and examines its preliminary effectiveness. Project 3 focuses on psychotropic medications, which are vital but poorly deployed treatments for schizophrenia. The project examines the feasibility and effectiveness of using mobile health technology and Experience Sampling Methods (ESM) to optimize psychopharmacologic regimens for individuals with first-episode psychosis. The OPAL Center will use common resources and methodologies to improve the implementation and personalization of treatments. As a complement to the quantitative data gathered in each project, we will use qualitative methods to get stakeholder input, particularly on techniques to maximize engagement in treatment, and to refine and adapt interventions for effective implementation in real-world settings.",P50,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9486324,P50MH115843,P50MH115843-01,115843,,,2018,1,520,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
1010,Text2Breathe: Enhance Parent Communication to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities,"Chronic diseases, such as asthma, disproportionately affect African American (AA) children. A key recommendation of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma is partnership between healthcare providers and patients (and their parents, for children). Facilitating parents' open communication with providers regarding healthcare status and concerns can equip them to more effectively partner with their child's primary care provider (PCP). Thus, improving the health communication skills of African American (AA) parents could improve parent's adherence to treatment recommendations including utilization of the primary care for asthma care, and ultimately improve their child's asthma health outcomes. Our team recently completed a randomized controlled trial of an in- person health communication intervention that resulted in more partnerships with PCPs for asthma care and lower urgent care usage, but effects were not sustained past 2 months post-intervention. Mobile technology, such as Short Message Service (SMS, ""text messaging""), is a low-cost means of extending the dosage and scope of this intervention and may be particularly useful among AAs, for whom the use of SMS is widespread. The proposed study involves a SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention (Text2Breathe) designed to equip urban, low-income AA parents with tools/techniques to empower parents to more effectively communicate with their children's PCP. 268 AA parents of children attending an emergency department asthma education clinic will be randomized to usual care or Text2Breathe. The Text2Breathe group will receive ongoing individualized text messages providing instruction about asthma care communication during the year- long intervention period. Outcome data on parental self-efficacy and outcome expectations, adherence to asthma care treatment recommendations (e.g., primary care utilization), and child asthma outcomes will be collected via structured telephone interviews at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-enrollment.

1023,Impacts of Later High School Start Times on Adolescent Weight and Weight-Related Behavior,"Although the National Sleep Foundation recommends 8.5 to 9.25 hours of sleep per night for adolescents, more than half of US 16-year-olds regularly get less than seven hours. ""Sleep debt"" has consequences that extend far beyond hampering day-to-day functioning as it is deleterious to multiple areas of physical and mental health. In the context of the obesity epidemic, which has had a far-reaching public health impact, sleep insufficiency is emerging as a potentially important and novel risk factor for the development of excess weight gain and weight gain-related behaviors. While a variety of forces such as screen time, homework expectations, and other factors can be implicated in stymying American teenagers' sleep, research has shown that early high school start times, which are asynchronous with adolescent biology, are one of the most significant obstacles to youth being able to net sufficient sleep. When children begin puberty, circadian rhythms shift such that melatonin is secreted later in the evening making it difficult to fall asleep before 11pm. This neurobiological change means that adolescents who attend ""early-start"" (prior to 8:30am) high schools, even those who strive for an early bedtime, will struggle to get sufficient sleep. Natural experiments have clearly shown that later school starts allow adolescents a greater opportunity to accumulate adequate sleep, but unfortunately 86% of US schools start before 8:30am. We hypothesize that later start times, an established effective sleep intervention, may promote weight-related health. Given that adolescence is a critical age that sets the stage for long-term obesity risk behavior patterns, there is an urgent need to understand the obesity-related implications of increased sleep as a result of intervention and policy changes. Presently there is a unique opportunity to study a community- based natural experiment in school start time policy modification. A Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN metro area school district, will be shifting the start tim of its high school from 7:30am to 8:30am in Fall 2016. We propose to collect data on student weight and related risks (via survey, objective weight and height measurement, and sleep actigraphy) before and after this change in this district and high school students in a comparison district which will not be altering its 7:30am high school start time. This research is time-sensitive as baseline, pre-policy measures must be collected before the end of the 2015/16 school year. Our specific aims are: 1) Determine how a shift to a later high school start time relates to objectively measured weight change over time. 2) Identify the relationship between school start times and obesity-related behaviors over time. We have an additional exploratory aim to assess barriers and facilitators associated with implementing later high school start times via stakeholder interviews. The products of this research will have public health impact because they will clarify causal connections between sleep and obesity among adolescents as well as provide evidence for whether a school policy can minimize unhealthy weight gain. If effective, later school start times, a policy deployable in communities across the US, could help prevent excess weight gain in youth.",R01,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9137059,R01HD088176,R01HD088176-01,88176,,,2016,1,512,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1039,Active for Life: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Physical inactivity is a growing health problem in the United States, especially for older people with chronic diseases such as COPD; in fact people with COPD are among the least active. Low levels of PA are associated with negative health outcomes including an increase in mortality and COPD exacerbations. Current PA guidelines focus on moderate-to-vigorous physical activities (MVPAs) that are too strenuous and not feasible for long term maintenance in many people with COPD. We propose a new paradigm for promoting physical activity (PA) in this population; focus on increasing time spent in light physical activity (LPA) and decreasing time spent in sedentary behavior. Growing evidence suggests that substantial health benefits are associated with increases in the volume of LPA. We propose to test the efficacy of our Active-for-Life (Active- Life) intervention and to quantify the mediating effects of potential mechanisms responsible for therapeutic outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that Active-Life will have positive effects on objectively measured PA. Active-Life is a 10 week intervention designed to increase total PA with an emphasis on increasing the time spent in LPA and decreasing sedentary time. Key components of Active-Life include (a) exercise with functional circuit training (FCT), walking and stretching in a laboratory-based exercise program that can easily be transitioned to the home setting with minimal equipment, (b) a behavioral component with a structured self- efficacy enhancing intervention that includes self-regulations strategies, (c) education that addresses the distinct health benefits of LPA and MVPA, the negative consequences of too much sedentary time, and an action plan for dealing with acute exacerbations of COPD and (d) follow-up with phone coaching and booster sessions. Active-Life establishes a goal for subjects, to increase total PA, combined LPA and MVPA, at least 60 minutes a day. This far exceeds the effects of other published PA interventions for people with COPD and if successful will advance PA science in clinically important ways. The Active-Life program was developed by Dr. Larson and through a series of preliminary studies; its feasibility is well established and preliminary data are promising. We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing Active-Life against an active control. We will enroll 183 people with moderate to very severe COPD. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, end of the 10 week intervention and at 3, 6 and 12 months after the end of the intervention. The primary dependent variables are objectively measured PA and sedentary behavior, measured with ActivPAL and Actigraph accelerometers simultaneously. Secondary outcome measures are indicators of frailty: 6-minute distance walk, isometric strength of knee flexors and extensors, Short Physical Performance Battery and self- reported physical function. Potential mediators include barriers-efficacy for PA and outcome expectations for PA. Innovations include the focus on LPA, objective measures of PA 24/7 and the use of FCT in COPD.

1046,Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography,"We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization.

1064,Optimizing a self-directed mobile mindfulness intervention for improving,"As survival has improved for the 2 million people with cardiorespiratory failure managed annually in US intensive care units (ICUs), it has become apparent that these patients suffer from severe and persistent post-discharge symptoms of psychological distress including depression, anxiety, and post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, few targeted interventions exist that are relevant to patients' experiences and that accommodate their many physical, social, and financial barriers to personalized care. To fill this gap, we developed an innovative app-based mobile mindfulness training program that promotes automated care delivery and self-management of symptom-related distress. Subsequently, we conducted a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) called the LIFT study (R34 AT00819) that compared mobile mindfulness to both a standard telephone mindfulness program and an ICU education control among survivors of cardiorespiratory failure. We found that mobile mindfulness was feasibly delivered, acceptable, usable, and had a greater clinical impact on psychological distress than either comparator. This trial also highlighted opportunities to improve the intervention's impact related to its targeted population, content delivery, and system technology. To address these gaps, we propose a 5-year project that is conceptualized as the Optimization Phase of a multiphase optimization study (MOST) framework. We will optimize mobile mindfulness with four specific aims: (1) Optimize the usability of key technological elements of mobile mindfulness; (2) Using a factorial experimental design, identify which intervention components contribute most meaningfully to feasibility, usability, and impact on psychological distress; (3) Explore barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation; and (4) Using a mixed methods approach and data from Aims 2 & 3, refine, update, and operationalize the final mMT intervention system. At the conclusion of this U01 involving 320 cardiorespiratory failure survivors, we will deliver a mobile mindfulness system fully optimized for usability, efficiency, scalability, and clinical impact that will be off-the-shelf ready for a next-step definitive RCT-and can serve as a model for distance-based mind and body interventions. Innovative elements of our U01 proposal include its paradigm-shifting automated stepped therapy approach and its easily disseminatable mobile app delivery system-attributes that could allow seamless, inexpensive population-level scaling of mMT and other mind-body therapies. This study addresses research priorities on distress symptoms, personalized precision medicine, and self- management outlined by the National Institutes of Health and numerous professional societies.

1096,Novel methods and devices to deliver substitution therapy in addiction,"Current treatment options for addiction do not sufficiently address the clinical needs of patients. Due to low efficacy, misaligned treatment objectives, or lack of accessibility, patients are not able to durably abstain from substances or reduce their use to safer levels. Substitution therapy (ST) is a proven treatment approach and has resulted in massive global public health benefits for tobacco use disorder and opioid use disorder; however, the potential impact of ST is limited by concerns for causing more widespread harms. Thus substitution therapy is either underutilized or underexplored in other addictions due to risks of abuse, misuse, and diversion. Through implementing safe prescribing systems, health systems have solved for the provision of existing ST like methadone and buprenorphine. Nevertheless, there remains significant potential for broader access to current and novel ST treatments by utilizing advancement in software and hardware technology. Atman Therapeutics is an early-stage company seeking to develop novel therapeutics in addictive disorders. We are developing a platform to enable increased access to as well as novel development of ST. To achieve this objective, our platform uses cutting-edge machine learning methods, patient-centered research, and sophisticated hardware technology. Our technology will also enable the concurrent delivery of contingency management services, thus creating safe, engaging, and durably effective treatments for these complex neurobehavioral disorders. This Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) project aims to establish the feasibility of machine learning and integrated sensor technologies to confirm medication adherence in a diverse sample of patients. We will develop a deep-learning algorithm utilizing a feed-forward convolutional neural network (CNN), such as ResNet- 50, U-NET, PCU-Net, to enact classification of medication ingestion events. We will also demonstrate the feasibility of integrating a hardware microcontroller unit with multi-dimensional MEMS sensors into a device that can classify ingestion events in a highly sensitive and specific manner. These efforts will demonstrate the early feasibility of the Atman platform and form the basis for regulated development efforts of ST-enabling products and services.",R43,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10325846,R43AA029964,R43AA029964-01A1,29964,A1,,2021,1,572,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
1112,Precision Cardiac CT: Development of a Computational Platform for Optimizing Imaging,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the US. Medical imaging is integral to the diagnosis and management of CAD fueling the development of new technologies and applications. However, imaging of the heart continues to be a challenging task. There is always a degree of temporal blur or motion artifact, the impact and documented limitations of which remain uncertain. Additionally, patient body habitus and technical limitations may contribute to high noise and degrade spatial resolution. For imaging modalities involving ionizing radiation like CT, radiation dose is also an ever-present reality that needs to be minimized without compromising image quality. Clinical trials are the best avenue for the evaluation of imaging technologies, but the ever-expanding number of technologies and parameters make a trial for every application or protocol unfeasible, pragmatically and financially. As a result, medical imaging researchers, industry, and the FDA are increasingly moving toward computerized simulations or 'virtual trials'. Virtual trials involve the use of computational tools to perform experiments entirely on the computer. Realistic patient models or phantoms are combined with validated imaging simulations to emulate imaging examinations and patient conditions. These can subsequently be used to ascertain how differing patient attributes and imaging conditions impact dose, image quality, and depiction of pre-defined known conditions. The findings can be used to prescribe specific imaging protocols and optimal scan parameters that are customized to individual patient anatomy to provide a sufficient degree of certainty for effective clinical decision-making. The goal of this project is to develop, validate, and distribute to the research community a computational platform (including a series of anatomically variable phantoms with realistic finite-element cardiac models, accurate models for modern imaging devices, and a suite of image quality metrics) to perform virtual trials in dynamic cardiac imaging. The virtual framework can be extended to any number of cardiac conditions, imaging modalities, and technologies. As a first case study in our long-term strategy, the focus of this project is on CT as it has both a great need for and great potential to provide high spatial and temporal resolution for the optimized evaluation of CAD. If CT image quality is not optimal, the evaluation of CAD, particularly the degree of stenosis and characterization of high-risk plaque features, may be compromised. The tools we develop will provide the first practical platform to characterize the precise impact of the technical aspects of CT on image quality over a wide range of patient anatomies with the view to enable optimal visualization of cardiac conditions at the lowest possible radiation dose for a given patient. The approach has great potential to significantly improve clinical investigations of heart disease, extending beyond CT imaging and CAD, paving the way towards faster translation of new cardiac imaging technologies into the clinic and more precise and personalized patient management.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9240231,R01HL131753,R01HL131753-01A1,131753,A1,,2017,1,580,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
1115,Acute preoperative sleep disruption and postoperative delirium,"Delirium and sleep disruption are both common in the older patients who are hospitalized. Delirium is a state of acute confusion, experienced especially by older adults admitted to the hospital, with the potential to adversely impact patients' outcome. Of hospitalized patients, one of the highest rates of delirium occurs after major surgery. Development of postoperative delirium is associated with longer hospital length of stay, significantly higher risk of functional decline, loss of independent living, and increased mortality. Previous studies have focused on describing the clinical manifestations and outcomes of postoperative delirium; yet, whether sleep disruption is associated with the development of delirium, has not been rigorously investigated. Sleep disruption, including changes in sleep patterns and architecture, and decreased quality of sleep are commonly observed in older subjects. In the hospital, environmental factors and health care practices further contribute to sleep disruption in the postoperative older patients. In preliminary data acquired from older surgical patients who were monitored with continuous wrist actigraphy, we observed that sleep disruption as measured by total wake time was significantly longer, and number of awakenings was significantly higher even before surgery. The pattern of sleep disruption observed before the planned surgery was associated with increased rates of postoperative delirium. In contrast to previous small studies investigating sleep and cognitive outcomes, we propose a comprehensive, exploratory prospective cohort study to test the hypothesis that preoperative sleep disruption is an independent predictor for postoperative delirium after adjusting for known risks for postoperative delirium. Also, in contrast to previous studies which focused only on the period after surgery, we propose to test the hypothesis that sleep disruption in older patients is prevalent before surgery and is associated with modifiable patient-related risk factors. In patients aged 65 years of age or older undergoing noncardiac surgery, we will measure sleep before and after surgery continuously using wrist actigraphy. Postoperative delirium will be measured daily with a valid and reliable measure. Our overall goal is to determine the relationship between sleep disruption before and after surgery in order to determine the optimal time period for intervention. In addition, we will also measure the risk factors associated with sleep disruption at home and after surgery to enable the development of strategies to improve sleep and minimize delirium. Our study results will be critical for designing future randomized clinical trials to target both patient- related and hospital-related factors that precipitate sleep disruption, with the ultimate goal to improve sleep hygiene and decreasing adverse postoperative cognitive outcomes.",R21,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9314897,R21AG053715,R21AG053715-01A1,53715,A1,,2017,1,558,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1120,Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium,"This proposal seeks funding to support a symposium, Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology (ABI), which will bring together recognized world experts in clinical, research, vision science, engineering, industrial and pharmaceutical communities as well as junior investigators (i.e., young faculty and those in training) to discuss the current state of ABI, ranging from bioelectronic implantable and wearable devices, to nanoscale scaffolds for stem cell and gene therapies. Given the multidisciplinary nature of this field, it is essential to bring together researchers and clinicians with varying levels of expertise across many domains related to ABI to advance the progress of this novel field, identify challenges of advancement, and develop a strategic action plan to overcome these challenges. The timing to have such a symposium to further the application of implantable and/or wearable bioengineered systems in ophthalmology is now as we focus on precision and personalized medicine and leverage the revolution in deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms. Through symposium talks, sessions, and discussions we will cover the fundamentals and also identify innovative and cutting-edge strategies and methodologies to accelerate the rate of major discoveries and development of novel therapeutics. The specific aims of this symposium are: Specific Aim 1. To bring together both established and junior investigators representing a broad range of disciplines to discuss cutting edge research in this novel field, catalyze the development of cross-disciplinary and translational approaches to advance abiotic-biotic interfaces for ophthalmology, and identify gaps in knowledge and barriers to advancement. We will identify research questions and develop an agenda to guide future research that is consistent with the objectives and interests of NEI. Specific Aim 2. Develop a junior investigator program to motivate a diverse group of students and junior investigators to pursue research careers in vision science and ophthalmologic therapeutic development, who will ultimately submit grant proposals to NEI solicitations and contribute to the scientific literature. Specific Aim 3. Develop a strategic action plan to set priorities for future studies that will encourage inter-agency collaborations (e.g., NEI, NSF, DARPA, etc.). This is critical because often certain engineering tasks are best suited to be supported by NSF or DARPA whereas the biological testing of the engineered systems lends itself to funding from NEI.

1128,CloudConnect: Consumer Health IT for Enhanced Treatment of Chronic Illness,"The purpose of this study is to develop and assess a new approach to self-management that recognizes that many patients with chronic conditions must manage their condition continuously and often do so within a social context. As care shifts to home- and community-based settings, multiple forms of consumer health information technology (IT) are being developed to support patients with their self-management responsibilities. In particular, remote monitoring systems-in which clinically relevant data are captured, analyzed, and converted into medically relevant information-carry potential for use in multiple chronic diseases that require constant oversight. Furthermore, consumer health IT is being advanced that is responsive to the fact that self- management rarely occurs in isolation; rather, patients often rely on others including a primary informal caregiver. Therefore, there is a need to create and evaluate approaches to self- management that integrate consumer health IT interventions facilitating continuous monitoring and both individual and group decision-making. This proposal seeks to refine and assess such an approach to self-management called CloudConnect, with two specific aims: 1) explicate patient and informal caregiver needs and preferences relevant to the technology core of this self-management approach and 2) evaluate the impact of this self-management approach on engagement and clinical outcomes. The proposed research addresses questions that relate to the design and performance of a self-management approach for Type 1 Diabetes that integrates remote monitoring of both physiological parameters and patient generated data, informatic processing of multiple data types to assess near-term risk of adverse events, computation of risk profiles that identify linkages between behavior and self-treatment outcomes, clinical decision support, and health information communication systems, all with a focus on dyads of adolescent patients and their local care givers. The first of two studies associated with this proposal is a needs assessment study that reveals patients' and primary informal caregivers' needs/preferences for the technology core of Cloud Connect. The second study is a randomized control trial that assesses CloudConnect in terms of patient engagement, dyad engagement, and clinical outcomes as well as the relationships among these outcome measures for adolescents with diabetes. The results of this project will inform the design information technology that improves engagement and clinical outcomes for patients who require continuous monitoring and who engage an informal primary caregiver in self-management outside clinical settings.",R01,LM,NLM,LM,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9106950,R01LM012090,R01LM012090-01A1,12090,A1,,2016,1,588,Chris,,,,,,,,,
1132,Large-Scale Nationally Representative Person-Generated Health Data for Development of Generalizable Data Science Methodologies for Precision Public Health,"Large-Scale Nationally Representative Patient-generated Health Data for Development of Generalizable Data Science Methodologies for Precision Public Health. Racial-ethnic minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and other underserved populations experience disproportionate adverse health outcomes despite decades of research correlating social determinants (SDs) to variations in health outcomes. Many public health approaches use population averages to create ""one-size-fits-all"" interventions to increase the probability of achieving the best outcomes for the average person, but are limited by population heterogeneity in number, magnitude, interplay, and amplification of SDs. Precision public health (PPH) emerged to use digital technologies (DTs) to develop interventions targeting unique needs of specific populations to improve the health and reduce disparities. Analysis of voluminous, precise, continuous, and longitudinal data generated by DTs holds great promise for PPH as smartphones, Internet of Things, and wearable sensors are becoming ubiquitous, generating data on environment, transportation, geolocation, diet, exercise, social interactions, and daily activities. These person-generated health data (PGHD) have unprecedented potential to add rich insight on everyday human behaviors to traditional health research. Though clinical PGHD applications are in early stages, there is rapid progress in development of digital indicators of health, offering virtually limitless potential. Because PGHD are typically captured outside of controlled research settings, they suffer from challenges of non-traditional data that impede their acceptance and use across the healthcare ecosystem. First, PGHD are vulnerable to input biases as users of consumer DTs are a self-selected group. Second, PGHD suffer from poor internal data quality due to high variability in completeness for reasons that are not always equally distributed across individuals (e.g., connectivity issues, battery, user forgetfulness, user error). Together, input bias and poor data quality lead to poor external validity, where analytics derived from PGHD are not generalizable to the broader population. The objective of this partnership between the RAND Corporation and Evidation Health is to improve generalizability of data science methods for PGHD, allowing for representation of all population groups, including the historically underserved. We will accomplish this goal via three aims: (i) generate PGHD from a nationally representative probability sample of Americans to understand the social distribution of user engagement with health DTs and poor sleep health; (ii) develop a methodology that characterizes missing data within PGHD and selects appropriate imputation strategies (existing and novel) optimized for reduction in model bias and socio- demographic input disparities; and, (iii) create a propensity-score based statistical weighting methodology to improve the effectiveness and applicability of methods derived from non-random, self-selected, and/or already collected PGHD in underserved populations. This work will enable future identification and application of digital indicators for health interventions that account for all populations, a critical first step for digital PPH.",R01,LM,NLM,LM,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10052114,R01LM013237,R01LM013237-01A1,13237,A1,,2020,1,590,Chris,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1134,Development of wearable technology to enable therapy personalization of 177Lu DOTATATE for neuroendocrine tumors,"For patients with metastatic, somatostatin-receptor-2 (SSTR2) positive neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), targeted therapy using 177Lu-DOTATATE greatly increases progression-free survival (PFS), as shown in the NETTER-1 trial. PFS at month 20 was 65.2% (95% CI, 50.0 - 76.8) for midgut NETs treated with 177Lu- DOTATATE alone compared to 10.8% (95% CI, 3.5 - 23.0) in a control group receiving 60 mg octreotide long- acting release every 4 weeks. Now that 177Lu-DOTATATE has FDA approval it likely will become the standard of care for symptomatic NET patients and those with metastatic spread. However, FDA package instructions call for patients to receive four 7.4 GBq treatments, regardless of size, weight, gender or patient health status. Traditionally, targeted radionuclide therapies are personalized based upon dose to the main organs at risk. Standardized therapy is counter to the ideals of personalized medicine and will lead to non-optimum therapeutic dosing for many patients. Traditional methods for organ dosimetry estimation for 177Lu (i.e., 6.65 day half-life) require 3-4 longitudinal imaging sessions spread out over ~7 days. This is expensive, utilizes a lot of clinic resources and is burdensome to the patient. The goal of this project is to enable precise individualized 177Lu-DOTATATE organ dosimetry without requiring serial imaging sessions (note: the main OAR for ~98% of patients receiving 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy is the kidneys). We will accomplish this by developing inexpensive, wearable monitoring technology to allow quantitative measurements to be made by the patient at home. This will support accurate estimation of the washout from individual organs at risk (OAR), enabling accurate organ dosimetry for each treatment session thereby allowing physicians to individually tailor the number of treatments based upon personalized organ dosimetry information. In Aim 1 methods to measure individual organ dose information from a wearable, low cost, personalized home dosimetry (PHD) belt will be developed using Monte Carlo simulation tools. In Aim 2, a prototype PHD belt for organ specific dose estimation will be fabricated. The belt will consist of 6-15 small, spectrographic counting detectors and weigh <750 grams depending upon the number of detectors incorporated into the belt. It will be designed to be light weight, form fitting and will have alignment features to enable consistent day to day wearing/positioning of the belt with respect to the patient's internal organs. The belt will further be equipped with electronics that can acquire, store and send the data via Wi-Fi to a secure web-site for near real time data monitoring. In Aim 3, a small pilot study to compare individual organ dosimetry estimates using a streamlined protocol (i.e., one SPECT/CT and PHD belt measurement at 24 hr post infusion plus 7-21 PHD belt at home measurements) versus 3-time point (i.e., 1, 4 and 7 day) in-clinic SPECT/CT imaging (i.e., standard protocol followed in many non-US countries) will be conducted. At the end of this project, methods to create and utilize a PHD belt will have been tested and validated and the PHD belt will be ready for evaluation in an early phase clinical trial.",R41,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10010282,R41CA243982,R41CA243982-01A1,243982,A1,,2020,1,591,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
1146,Effectiveness of advanced practice pharmacy services among American Indian and Alaska Native adults with diabetes,"Effectiveness of advanced practice pharmacy services among American Indian and Alaska Native adults with diabetes The Indian Health Service (IHS) funds services for approximately 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs).IHS health care resources are strained due to limited per capita spending, the disproportionate high costs of treating AI/ANs with diabetes, and provider shortages. All-cause mortality of AI/ANs is 46% higher than that of non-Hispanic whites, attributable in part to higher mortality associated with diabetes. Within IHS, the provision of advanced practice pharmacy (APP) services for adults with diabetes has increased. During fiscal year (FY) 2008, approximately 1% of AI/ANs with diabetes used APP. Just 5 years later, 9.6% (n=4,620) had at least 1 APP visit in FY2013. To date, IHS has not had the institutional capacity to fully characterize the provision of APP services, nor study its effectiveness or costs. Given the need to both improve outcomes for patients with diabetes and effectively utilize limited IHS resources, this study's goal is to describe and assess the effectiveness of emerging models of APP within IHS for treatment of diabetes. Since 2010, IHS and Tribes have collaborated with the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health at the University of Colorado to create a longitudinal data infrastructure with health status, service utilization, and treatment cost data for over 640,000 AI/ANs who represent nearly 30% of AI/ANs who use IHS services. The infrastructure, created through the Improving Health Care Delivery Data Project, is a synthesis of existing electronic data from multiple IHS platforms and currently includes data for 7 years (FY2007-2013) for 15 project sites. We propose to continue this collaboration by updating the infrastructure with recent data (FY2014-2017) to evaluate APP effectiveness among AI/AN adults with diabetes using statistical techniques made possible by the longitudinal data. The study has 3 aims: 1. Characterize APP delivery models for adults with diabetes within sites and over time using site characteristics and patient health risk profiles (e.g., glycemic level [A1c], blood pressure [BP], cholesterol [CHL], cardiovascular disease). We anticipate that up to 3 models may emerge (e.g., Targeted, Limited, and General); and 2. For each APP model, evaluate the nature and extent of the relationship between patient APP use and outcomes. Within each model, we expect that APP will improve medication adherence and A1c, BP, and CHL levels, and reduce onset of complications and preventable hospital stays; and 3. Estimate APP delivery costs, treatment cost changes associated with lower use of other health services, and cost-effectiveness. We expect the APP models to be cost-effective. 1",R18,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9379777,R18DK114757,R18DK114757-01,114757,,,2017,1,597,Audie,,,,,,,,,
1171,A Randomized Trial of Physical Activity for Cognitive Functioning in Breast Cancer Survivors,"Difficulties with cognition are extremely common among breast cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy and can significantly impact quality of life, daily functioning, and ability to return to work. Unfortunately, there is limited evidence to guide management of cancer survivors' cognition. One promising intervention is increasing physical activity as it has been effective in improving cognition in non-cancer populations; however, few intervention trials have included cancer survivors. Breast cancer survivors often decrease physical activity following treatment and have very low levels of physical activity overall. Cognitive impairments are associated with greater anxiety and depression, while increasing physical activity has been shown to decrease anxiety and depression, suggesting that psychological variables could mediate the association between physical activity and cognitive impairment. Biological mechanisms may also link physical activity with cognition including synaptic plasticity and cellular aging. This project builds upon our previous work indicating that increased physical activity can improve objectively-measured processing speed and self-reported cognition among breast cancer survivors. The current proposal will examine whether a physical activity intervention improves cognition among 250 post-treatment breast cancer survivors (Stages I-III, <5 years post-treatment, treated with chemotherapy) who are reporting cognitive difficulties. We propose to conduct a 6-month intervention with a 12-month follow-up, 2-arm RCT comparing a physical activity intervention using individual counseling and Fitbit activity trackers (Exercise Arm), with a healthy aging attention-comparison condition (Healthy Aging Arm) to examine intervention effects on objectively measured processing speed and self- reported cognition (at 3 and 6 months) and maintenance of the effect at 12 months. The primary aim is to (1) investigate the impact of the Exercise arm on changes in cognition compared to the healthy Aging arm. The secondary aims are to (1) investigate the impact of the Exercise arm on maintenance of changes in cognition compared to the Healthy Aging arm; (2) examine candidate biological mechanisms and psychological mediators of intervention-related changes in cognition.

1183,Novel pharmacotherapy strategies for obesity in schizophrenia,"Cardiovascular disease represents a major cause of reduced lifespans in people with schizophrenia, which has been estimated at 15 - 25 years shorter than the general population. Obesity and associated metabolic problems, such as hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, are important contributors to cardiovascular disease, represent known side effects of antipsychotic medications, and are highly prevalent in schizophrenia. However, pharmacological treatment options for this patient group are limited given that many FDA-approved weight loss drugs are sympathomimetic, which can raise the risk of psychotic exacerbation. Metformin, an antihyperglycemic that acts in part via glucagon-like peptide-1 to reduce appetite and slow gastric emptying, has been found to safely reduce weight in non-diabetic overweight people with schizophrenia. Our group recently found that 16 weeks of adjunctive metformin led to 2 kg differential weight loss compared to placebo in 146 overweight people with schizophrenia. Because weight loss with metformin is modest, the identification of other safe, non-sympathomimetic options for this population is critical. Lorcaserin is a 5-HT2C agonist recently approved for weight loss. Lorcaserin is associated with ~5.5 kg weight loss compared to baseline and ~3 kg weight loss compared to placebo over 52 weeks in overweight, otherwise healthy adults. The appetite-reducing effect of lorcaserin is mediated in part through melanocortin receptor 4. Given significant weight loss from each of these two drugs with distinct mechanisms of action, this study will build on our preliminary data with metformin to test a strategy of metformin/lorcaserin combination treatment versus lorcaserin monotherapy versus placebo in overweight people with schizophrenia. In non-psychiatric populations, combination treatment has been used successfully for weight loss (i.e., phentermine/topiramate combination treatment) and for other chronic disorders such as hypertension, epilepsy, and diabetes when monotherapy was inadequate. 90 overweight people with schizophrenia (BMI>27) will participate in a 52-week double-blind, randomized study to assess the efficacy and safety of lorcaserin/metformin combination treatment, lorcaserin monotherapy and placebo on weight, body composition, and measures of glucose and lipid metabolism. Behavioral assessments of appetite and plasma levels of key appetite-regulating hormones including leptin, ghrelin and GLP-1 will be measured to examine mechanisms of action of lorcaserin and metformin for weight loss in this population. 24- hour food-recall assessments and accelerometer-based physical activity assessments will help determine the potentially confounding effects of energy intake and expenditure. All subjects will receive a behavioral intervention promoting a healthy diet and increased physical activity. The current proposal will help define new and safe long-term options for treating obesity in people with schizophrenia, critical for this vulnerable population with high rates of obesity and associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",R01,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9029873,R01DK105526,R01DK105526-01A1,105526,A1,,2016,1,592,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
1210,2/3: The Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative (ChicagoCHEC),"OVERALL - ABSTRACT The Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative (ChicagoCHEC) is a comprehensive partnership to advance cancer health equity bringing together the synergistic strengths of two federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), with a world class NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center - the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (NU-LCC). ChicagoCHEC combines the attributes of these three exceptional institutions, each with robust capacity to interact with their urban-shared setting. Launched in 2015, ChicagoCHEC is dedicated to advancing cancer health equity through rigorous and innovative science, education, and outreach and engagement of Chicago's underserved communities. This is reflected in the following goals: Aim 1. To strengthen a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and the NU-LCC in pursuit of cancer health equity in Chicago; Aim 2. To initiate, conduct, and support innovative bench, translational, clinical, and prevention and control focused cancer research, with emphasis on cancer health disparities; Aim 3. To develop and implement cancer-related education and outreach activities generated with the engagement of underserved communities across Chicago; Aim 4. To coordinate research education and mentoring opportunities to recruit, retain, and advance a pipeline of underrepresented students in cancer research careers and to develop early career faculty who will forge independent cancer research careers; and Aim 5. To conduct ongoing rigorous evaluation of ChicagoCHEC activities. These goals are accomplished by a nurturing hub of four Cores (Administrative, Planning and Evaluation, Research Education, and Outreach) and a research project funding program. Since the launch of ChicagoCHEC in 2015, there has been rapid growth in collaborative infrastructure built across the three partnering institutions; enhanced cancer research engagement, capacity, and education; extensive community outreach and engagement; and encouraging advancement of ChicagoCHEC faculty and students. ChicagoCHEC projects and programs provided research experiences to 155 students, provided cancer research and leadership opportunities for 57 faculty (21 have been promoted/received tenure), and directly resulted in 94 peer-reviewed publications, 47 extramural grants submitted, and 24 grants awarded. ChicagoCHEC will leverage the momentum forged by the initial U54 award to drive innovative cancer research, research education, and community outreach and engagement that cuts across disciplinary and institutional boundaries. ChicagoCHEC will leverage its diverse team of faculty, students, and partners, connectivity to Chicago's underserved communities, and guidance of internal and external advisory bodies. The next chapter will include two initial full cancer research projects and two initial pilot projects, continued support from four tri-institutional ChicagoCHEC Cores, and strong institutional commitment.",U54,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,10082818,U54CA202995,U54CA202995-06,202995,,,2020,6,632,Chris,,,,,,,,,
1248,TB-TST (TB treatment support tools): Refinement and evaluation of an interactive mobile app and direct adherence monitoring on TB treatment outcomes,"The overall goal of this study is to refine the tuberculosis (TB) treatment support tools (TB-TST) intervention, which links an app developed using user-centered design principles and a paper-based drug metabolite urine test strip modified for home use, to improve treatment outcomes for patients with TB, and evaluate its impact by a RCT. TB is an urgent global health threat and the world's deadliest infectious disease despite it being largely curable. Poor medication adherence to TB regimens, along with challenges in monitoring patients and returning them to treatment, are important contributing factors to poor outcomes and the development of drug resistance. Individuals with TB face multiple barriers to good treatment adherence such as medication side effects, stigma, and lack of education about the disease and its treatment. With advances in, and proliferation of, mobile technology platforms, there is substantial interest in the possible use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions to address these challenges. Of the mHealth approaches under investigation for TB adherence monitoring, drug metabolite testing has been identified as the most promising, ethical, and accurate, and the least intrusive and stigmatizing strategy compared to other mobile solutions (eg, video observation, ""smart"" medication bottles, ingestible sensor), yet its potential remains largely unexplored. Additionally, mobile applications (apps) may provide personalized treatment supervision, increase patients' self-management and improve patient-provider communication by offering more advanced functionalities for patient support and monitoring. However, available TB-related apps have not focused on patients as the end- users nor have they been fully evaluated. This proposal builds on preliminary work to 1) combine input from patients and experts to iteratively design the content, features, functionalities, and interface of the treatment support app and 2) optimize a paper-based test strip for testing the presence of isoniazid drug metabolites in urine to directly monitor adherence to treatment. The existing version of the TB-TST app has the following functionalities: it offers education on TB and its treatment, communication with a care-coordinator, tracks treatment adherence (both by self-reporting and direct metabolite test strip images), self-reports treatment side-effects, and retains patient's ""diary"" notes. The results from the pilot test of this version will be the starting point for this proposed study. Aims are to: 1) Refine the TB-TST intervention based on pilot study findings and apply principles of user-centered design; 2) Evaluate the impact of the TB-TST on treatment outcomes (success, default) compared to usual care; 3) Assess patient and provider perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to implementation of the TB-TST and synthesize lessons learned with stakeholders and policy makers. The primary outcome will be treatment success. Secondary outcomes will include: treatment default rates, self-reported adherence, technology use and usability. Findings have broader implications not only for TB adherence but disease management more generally and will improve our understanding of how to support patients facing challenging treatment regimens.",R01,AI,NIAID,AI,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9802767,R01AI147129,R01AI147129-01,147129,,,2019,1,651,Leonie,,,,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
1252,Developing and Testing a Digital Toolkit to Improve Colorectal Cancer Screening Rates in Federally Qualified Health Centers,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States. National guidelines recommend that average risk people receive regular CRC screenings. Community health centers, such as federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), provide high quality affordable healthcare to underserved populations across the nation. Among patients treated at FQHCs, only 44% have completed a CRC screening within the recommended timeframe (e.g., one colonoscopy per ten years). Patient navigation has proven effective for improving CRC screening completion rates and screening quality. The effects of patient navigation are robust across socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic group. Furthermore, extensive research has proven its efficacy in FQHC settings. Although efficacious, patient navigation requires staffing and economic resources limiting its ability to be widely disseminated, particularly in low-resourced settings like FQHCs. The proposed study aims to refine and test a digital health solution, called the eNav Toolkit, designed to improve CRC screening uptake among patients treated at FQHCs. The eNav Toolkit will be a web app that will assist with CRC screening decision making, appointment reminders, preparation instructions/reminders, education, motivational interviewing support, and linkage to follow up care. In order to maximize reach, the eNav Toolkit will be accessible on any smartphone, tablet, or computer devise. For Aim 1, the eNav Toolkit 1.0 will be field tested on 10 participants. Participants will be FQHC patients eligible for CRC screening. The field test results be applied to refine the eNav content and improve the user-experience. The second iteration of the intervention, eNav Toolkit 2.0, will then be field tested on a new set of 10 participants. The results from the second field test will be applied to refine and finalize the eNav Toolkit. Aim 2 will conduct a multi-site randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the eNav Toolkit for improving CRC screening uptake among patients treated at FQHCs. Patients (N=400) will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: eNav Toolkit group (N=200) or usual care group (N=200). Participants in the eNav Toolkit group will engage with the eNav Toolkit to assist in preparing for and completing the CRC screening. Participants in the usual care group will receive usual care. Primary outcomes (CRC screening completion) and secondary outcomes (CRC screening quality, follow up adherence) will be evaluated at six months after study enrollment. Aim 3 will evaluate theoretical mechanisms of change (e.g., perceived benefits, perceived barriers, perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy), guided by the health belief model. If proven efficacious, the eNav Toolkit will be integrated in the electronic health record (EHR) and disseminated across FQHCs nationwide, with the ultimate goal of decreasing the burden of CRC among patients treated at FQHCs.",R01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10211851,R01CA248981,R01CA248981-01A1,248981,A1,,2021,1,653,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
1269,Peer Empowerment Program for Physical Activity in Low Income & Minority Seniors,"Peer Empowerment Program for Physical Activity in Low Income & Minority Seniors Older adults are the least active population group in the US. Yet, research has shown that an increase in physical activity (PA) can have immediate and profound effects on cardiovascular health. Older adults who are active use significantly fewer health care resources, and with the increasing number of older adults in the US it is imperative to curb health care expenditure in this group. Many PA interventions are flawed because they focus on individual motivations and ignore variations in community resources, neighborhood walkability, and safety. Low income and ethnically diverse communities have disproportionately fewer resources and less supportive neighborhoods. This contributes to lower PA levels and health disparities in obesity, diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. National and international health institutions have called for community based PA programs to improve population health. Senior centers are an ideal setting for PA interventions because they serve a large number of older adults and there are funding mechanisms for delivery of evidence based programs. While there are multiple benefits of different PA programs, national guidelines for PA still emphasize aerobic activity. Senior Centers currently offer group based PA programs but our preliminary studies show that 1) low income, ethnically diverse older adults attending such centers are not meeting PA guidelines, 2) evidence based programs in such centers do not generate moderate intensity PA, 3) they do not provide behavioral strategies to support more frequent and independent PA and 4) members are not involved in the delivery of such programs which may increase engagement and sustainability. We propose to build upon our NHLBI R01 funded PA program that increased aerobic activity in retirement community residents. The program was delivered by UCSD health educators for 6 months with the help of peer leaders who then sustained it over 12 months. To improve upon this work, we propose a train the trainer model with a greater focus on empowering the peer leaders, center staff and participants to self-monitor, self-organize and advocate for additional resources from the start. Since our aim is to test a PA program that can be adopted by local area aging agencies with Older Americans Act Title IIID funds, we will employ an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design; which allows for the concurrent testing of both intervention and implementation strategies and outcomes. We will also extend program monitoring to 24 months. Thus, in a 2-year cluster randomized controlled field trial of 408 ethnically diverse, older adults (50+ years old) in 12 low income Senior Centers in San Diego County we will investigate the efficacy of PEP4PA (Peer Empowerment Program 4 Physical Activity) to reduce disparities in PA by increasing the percentage of participants achieving 150 minutes of PA per week and to improve physical functioning & fitness, blood pressure, depressive symptoms and quality of life at 6, 12 & 24 months. We will assess the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of PEP4PA in terms of cost per MET hour and cost per QALY compared to usual programming in the control centers at 12 & 24 months.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8797221,R01HL125405,R01HL125405-01,125405,,,2015,1,635,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1290,Wearable Cardiotocography System,"Cardiotocography (CTG) provides safe and effective monitoring of fetal cardiovascular status before and during labor, and allows for more efficient utilization of dedicated patient care time provided by nurses, midwives, and physicians. However, current external fetal ultrasound transducers (US) and tocodynamometers (TOCO) are cumbersome in design and often produce false data due to loss of the fetal heart rate (FHR) signal, loss of the uterine contraction signal, and improper fit. The current model lacks freedom of maternal movement as it is rigid, requires minimally adjustable belts, and is tethered to a cart based CTG monitor. Simple movement of the laboring mother often causes signal interference, leading to gaps in data pertaining to fetal well-being, chronic repositioning of the external US and TOCO devices, and consequent alarm fatigue of the clinical staff. The high incidence of malpractice claims in obstetric care and the importance of CTG strips in birth injury liability claims further underscore the need for more reliable US and TOCO devices. Farus proposes to assess the feasibility of a vastly improved CTG system that features wearable US and TOCO devices. The wearable US and TOCO devices will be soft, conformal, adhere to the skin, and have wireless and belt-free operation. The improved devices will provide more reliable output of FHR and uterine contractions, independent of maternal movement or repositioning. The ultimate goals are to reduce the need for chronic repositioning of the US and TOCO, reduce the rate at which alarms are activated by false data or interference, and encourage freedom of maternal movement. The improved devices offer clinical staff the assurance of safe and effective CTG monitoring, while improving patient comfort and satisfaction. Further, a complete wireless telemetry system solution will be developed, improving maternal mobility that is currently limited by the length of wires connected to the CTG monitor. Together, these innovations will provide significant improvement over existing rigid and hard-wired devices, bettering patient care and the practice of nurses and practitioners involved in obstetric care. The hypothesis of the Fast-Track SBIR is that wearable US and TOCO devices can more consistently maintain the FHR and uterine contraction signals than standard devices, with improved signal quality and superior patient and clinician satisfaction. The goal of the Phase I SBIR effort is to build an alpha prototype of a wearable TOCO, integrate it with an accompanying wearable US and wireless base-station, and verify performance of the components and integrated system through benchtop laboratory tests and a pilot clinical study. The goal of the Phase II SBIR effort is to develop a refined beta prototype of the complete wearable CTG system, including a wearable US and TOCO, to validate its performance through antenatal and intrapartum clinical trials, and to perform regulatory testing. It is anticipated that the complete SBIR effort will lead to an FDA 510(k) application and commercialization of the technology.",R44,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8834351,R44HD082898,R44HD082898-01,82898,,,2015,1,672,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1298,The Impact of COVID-19 on End-of-Life Care for Vulnerable Populations,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has thus far caused 100,000 deaths in the U.S. and has disproportionately impacted vulnerable subpopulations, including those with underlying serious illness and those from racial and ethnic minority groups. As of June 2020, New York City (NYC) has seen 16,000 deaths and remains the global epicenter of the pandemic. Although public health containment and mitigation policies including social distancing, infection control, and self-quarantine are considered to have reduced transmission of COVID-19, they also brought about significant disruption in the way individuals sought and accessed care, particularly those with serious illness. Hospice organizations have played a key role in supporting seriously ill patients in their homes throughout the pandemic by ensuring effective symptom management (e.g., pain and dyspnea); psychological support for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals; and support for complex decision-making. Yet there has been scant evidence on hospice practices during COVID-19 and less guidance for hospice organizations throughout the U.S. to improve preparedness. Indeed, at the height of the pandemic, concomitant with the surge in demand for hospice care in NYC, we experienced a shortfall in hospice delivery, exposing latent vulnerabilities in the capacity of the existing system to respond to a crisis that demanded a coordinated, synchronized approach. In this innovative mixed methods study, we seek to gain an in-depth understanding of the challenges of delivering end-of-life care in NYC during the COVID-19 pandemic triangulating the experiences of patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers. Specifically, we will link clinical notes of patient encounters across Mount Sinai clinical programs and community hospice to create longitudinal trajectories of patients' end-of-life care during the pandemic to elucidate barriers in access to hospice care and care coordination deficiencies experienced by patients and families during this time. We will augment this information with insights from in-depth interviews of key stakeholders including frontline clinical providers, program leadership, staff, and caregivers. Our interviews with interdisciplinary hospice personnel, will identify new policies and practices hospices enacted in response to COVID-19, barriers and facilitators to implementation, perceived impact, and sustainability. Finally, through a national survey of hospices, we will determine how implementation of policy and practice changes varied across the U.S. The proposed project is innovative for its rapid, mixed methods approach to studying a highly vulnerable population during a pandemic to inform current and future care planning and policy, using analyses of retrospective and prospective data in combination with qualitative interviewing. Results will contribute new scientific knowledge as to how hospices adapted care processes to improve patient and family end-of-life care during an emergency, inform the development of educational tools to promote emergency preparedness, and dissemination of guidance for hospices regarding strategies and adaptations to improve end-of-life care.",R01,NR,NINR,NR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10184637,R01NR019792,R01NR019792-01,19792,,,2021,1,676,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1304,A personal exposure and response monitoring system for pediatric asthma study,"This project will focus on creating a button-sized wearable sensor for monitoring personal exposure to both chemicals and particulate matter. This unprecedented capability will pair with physiological signal monitors to provide both environmental exposure and physiological response data. The data communication of the device will be designed such that it can be plugged into a smartphone or cloud computing data management system for easy access and analysis of the data by epidemiologists. Such a system will have an impact on the epidemiological study of the pollution exposure-response relationship, and eventually the prevention of pediatric asthma. The project will provide a wearable exposure sensor to address the challenges proposed by RFA-EB-15-002, Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS): Sensor Development Projects for Asthma (U01). The sensor will be designed to pair with other physiological signal monitors, and plug into other data management system developed by PRISMS. The specific objectives of the project are to: 1) Develop a button-sized sensor that can monitor indoor and outdoor exposure of a child 24 hours a day. The initial target analytes include important potential asthma triggers, such as particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and formaldehyde, as well as temperature and humidity, but the sensor platform is expandable to allow inclusion of more analytes in the future. The sensor also includes an accelerometer chip to track whether the subjects actually wear the sensor as intended. 2) Pair the button-sized personal exposure sensor with physiological signal monitors, and develops seamless data communication with an Asthma Study App, and 3) validate the entire system via a small-scale pilot study. The project will bring together strengths in chemical sensors, particulate matter detectors, epidemiology, and digital health from different groups.

1305,"Ethnic Influences on Stress, Energy Balance and Obesity in Adolescents","Obesity is one of the most serious public health problems in the US; its prevalence has tripled in the last three decades and is associated with a range of short- and long-term medical and psychosocial problems. Adolescence is a critical period for the development and persistence of obesity, and is associated with changes in diet, physical activity and fitness, fat distribution and insulin sensitivity. There are racial and sex-specific disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity. African-American (AA) females have the highest rates of obesity, and the clustered risk factors for coronary heart disease and metabolic syndrome are twice that of AA males. The reasons for racial and sex-specific disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity are not well understood. AA experience higher stress levels than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) due to economic and social inequalities, and the effect of stress on energy-dense diet and adiposity is more prominent in females. A better understanding of the mechanisms that link stress to obesity, particularly during adolescence when high rates of obesity, increased stressful experiences and stronger behavioral and physiological responses to stress emerge, will contribute to new clinical guidelines for reducing obesity and associated medical conditions in AA females. The Physiological stress system affects obesity and mediates its adaptive functions via hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Prolonged stress-induced glucocorticoid secretion promotes the consumption of energy-dense diet (EI) and abdominal fat deposition both directly and indirectly through its effects on metabolic hormones. Stress also reduces physical activity and alters energy balance. The proposed study will examine the effects of stress and HPA axis on EI and physical activity-related energy expenditure in 100 AA and 100 NHW adolescent females. The effects on EI will be assessed in two contexts, the natural environment and under controlled conditions incorporating a standardized psychosocial stressor. Stress will be assessed in the natural environment as multiple domains (i.e., individual, family and social), and several indices of the HPA axis will be obtained to represent diurnal variation, its status over 12-15 weeks and reactivity to stress. Obesity- related parameters will be measured through anthropometry, fat distribution and cardio-metabolic biomarkers. Associations among stress, HPA activity/function, energy balance and obesity-related parameters will be compared between and within AA and NHW samples. In combination they will improve our understanding of the social factors and biobehavioral mechanisms of both racial and individual differences in obesity and facilitate the development of effective treatments within and across racial groups according to the principles of individualized medicine. To our knowledge, racial differences in objectively-measured diet intake and energy expenditure in response to stress, or their underlying physiological mechanisms, have not been assessed in adolescents or adults. This is an important knowledge gap in our efforts to develop better evidence-based translational obesity prevention and weight-control interventions as the traditional interventions are not effective with minority youth.",R01,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9250282,R01MD010757,R01MD010757-01A1,10757,A1,,2017,1,653,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
1316,Self fitting of Amplification: Methodology and Candidacy,"The high cost of hearing aids is a major barrier underlying low treatment rates for hearing loss. Self-fitting of amplification can reduce the cost of service delivery and follow-up by allowing users to adjust amplification for their hearing needs and listening environments. The goal of this project is to determine the efficacy of self- fitting protocols by which users can (1) make initial adjustments to the electroacoustic and signal-processing characteristics of amplification and (2) modify those characteristics on the basis of experience, and in response to changing acoustic environments. The project involves interdisciplinary collaboration between audiologists, hearing scientists, and engineers. In the R21 phase, we will evaluate the efficacy of a self-adjustment protocol using a computer simulation with built-in sounds. Simultaneously, we will develop a system with ear-level assemblies and on-line speech processing capabilities. In the R33 phase, modifications to the self-fitting protocol will be evaluated, with the goal of optimizing outcomes while maintaining simplicity for independent operation by novice users. In parallel, engineering will incorporate the findings into a wearable device and add sound-input characterization and noise-management features. The sound-input characterization feature will collect and log sound-input data before, during and after user self-adjustment. Efficacy of the wearable system will be evaluated in the laboratory and in field studies: 1) to compare objective and subjective outcomes for self-adjusted and audiologist-adjusted settings, and 2) to evaluate self-adjustment patterns in everyday environments and determine the influence of acoustic input and user-related factors such as sound tolerance, personality, and working memory.",R21,DC,NIDCD,DC,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9021532,R21DC015046,R21DC015046-01,15046,,,2016,1,685,Josh,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
1318,Developing and testing a telehealth intervention to increase HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake and adherence among sexual minority men in Nigeria,"In Nigeria, sexual minority men (SMM) have disproportionately higher levels of HIV compared to the general population. With high adherence, daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) reduces risk for HIV acquisition among SMM. Increasing PrEP uptake and adherence could significantly reduce HIV incidence, but to date no PrEP intervention have focused on SMM in Nigeria. The scientific premise of this K01 application is that a telehealth delivery model for PrEP could circumvent barriers to PrEP access for SMM in Nigeria. There is a strong proof of concept for the proposed approach given that telehealth interventions to enhance PrEP access have been shown to be acceptable and have increased PrEP uptake and adherence, among SMM in the U.S. While telehealth interventions in Nigeria have increased utilization of other health services, no study has investigated the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of delivering PrEP health services to SMM in Nigeria through a telehealth approach. Overview of project. My long-term goal is to become an independent researcher with expertise in developing and testing telehealth interventions to improve HIV prevention and care outcomes among SMM in sub-Saharan Africa. In Year 1, I will conduct qualitative interviews with HIV-negative SMM (n=20), peer educators (n=20), and healthcare providers (n=20) in Lagos Nigeria to identify the content, format, and foreseeable challenges to implementing a telemedicine intervention to increase PrEP awareness, uptake, and adherence among SMM. In Year 2, I will conduct qualitative interviews with SMM (n=30) to iteratively design a telemedicine intervention to increase PrEP uptake and adherence among SMM in Lagos, Nigeria. In Years 3-5, I will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the telemedicine intervention to optimize PrEP adherence over 6 months with 90 PrEP-naïve, HIV-negative high risk SMM in Lagos, Nigeria. My successful completion of the proposed research and training aims will position me to submit a R01 in the final year of this grant to conduct a multisite, RCT to test the intervention's efficacy.",K01,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10542292,K01MH129165,K01MH129165-01A1,129165,A1,,2022,1,686,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
1328,TREAT (Time Restricted EATing) to improve cardiometabolic health,"American adults have a high prevalence of overweight, obesity and prediabetes. Small weight loss delays the progression to type 2 diabetes and decrease cardiovascular risk, yet adherence to long-term calorie restriction is difficult to sustain. There is an urgency to find effective, easy-to-implement and sustain, and affordable life style interventions. Restricting the food intake interval, or time restricted eating (TRE) has been shown in small-scale pilot studies to result in weight loss and improve metabolism, while being less challenging than calorie count. We propose to rigorously assess the efficacy of TRE, administered via a smartphone application, on weight loss and decreased cardiovascular risk. To achieve this goal, metabolically unhealthy mid-life adults with overweight or obesity who habitually eat for more than 14h/day, will be randomized to a restricted eating window to 10h/d (TRE) or to their habitual eating window (≥ 14h, HABIT), and followed up to 12 months. Ambulatory measures of food intake, sleep, physical activity and glucose, and in-patient 24-h well-controlled studies will be done to determine the effect of TRE versus habitual eating duration (HABIT), as well as the mediators of these effects. Hypotheses: 1) TRE vs. HABIT will result in decreased fat mass, measured by quantitative magnetic resonance, and effect mediated via decreased daily total energy intake, measured by double labeled water; 2) TRE vs. HABIT will result in lower insulin resistance, lower glycemia and shift in fuel utilization preferentially to lipid mobilization; 2) Adherence to TRE (measured by usage of the app and reduction of the eating window), and self-efficacy will associate with the short-term effect (3 months) and the long-term sustainability (12 months) of TRE on fat mass loss. Results from this study will provide important insights into understanding the physiological and molecular interactions between restricting daily eating interval and metabolic function, and could provide evidence for using TRE interventions to improve metabolic health and decrease cardiovascular risk in the large number of mid-life and older Americans in great need of life style intervention.",R01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10048822,R01AG065569,R01AG065569-01A1,65569,A1,,2020,1,691,Chris,,,,,,,,,
1347,Aging: Sleep and Inflammatory Mechanisms in Depression Prevention,"Depression, one of the most common diseases in older adults, carries significant risk for morbidity, and mortality. However, many older adults with depression are not identified, and even when identified, they face protracted courses of treatment, with nearly two-thirds of elderly patients failing to achieve symptomatic remission. Given the burgeoning population of older adults, as well as the enormous burden of depression, efforts to maximize depression prevention are needed. Prior history of depression is a robust risk predictor of depression in older adults. Furthermore, we have found that sleep disturbance is prospectively associated with depression recurrence in older adults independent of other depressive symptoms, as well as antidepressant and hypnotic medication use. In this study, we hypothesize that recognition and treatment of sleep disturbance, a modifiable behavioral risk factor, will prevent depression recurrence in older adults who have a history of depression. In addition, because increasing evidence also implicates inflammation as a biological mechanism that contributes to depression, we further hypothesize that increases in inflammation are associated with the link between sleep disturbance and depression recurrence. The over-arching objective of this proposal is to evaluate the ability of a behavioral intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy for sleep quality (CBT-SQ) to reduce sleep complaints, depression recurrence, and cellular and genomic markers of inflammation in older adults with sleep complaints who have a prior history of depression. In this select and targeted older adult population, we aim to: 1) evaluate the effects of CBT-SQ vs. Sleep Seminar (SS) on objective (actigraphy) and subjective (sleep diary; questionnaire) measures of sleep symptoms over a two-year follow-up; 2) determine the effects of CBT-SQ vs. SS on recurrence of depressive symptoms and depression episode(s) over a two-year follow-up. We will also secondarily examine the effects of CBT-SQ vs. SS on cellular and genomic markers of inflammation over a two-year follow-up, and explore whether markers of inflammation and cytokine genetic polymorphisms explain variability in the risk of depression recurrence in those older adults receiving CBT-SQ vs. SS. This study is highly significant and innovative by focusing on prevention, rather than treatment, of depression in older adults; identifying a high risk group that takes into account both non-modifiable (i.e., prior history of depression) and modifiable (i.e., sleep disturbance) risk factors; using an intervention that specifically targets a modifiable risk factor (i.e., sleep disturbance) with implications for trial efficiency and efficacy; and examining a biological risk factor (i.e., inflammation), which has the potential to inform understanding of the pathways that contribute to depression and its prevention.",R01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8811075,R01AG026364,R01AG026364-10,26364,,,2015,10,674,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1352,"Facilitating supervised self-management of stimulant medications among adolescents: improving adherence, reducing stigma, and supporting caregivers","PillSmart: Abstract Stimulant medications are efficacious in reducing impulsivity and other ADHD symptoms in youth, which is important because youth with ADHD have an increased risk of developing substance use disorders. Youth's non-adherence of stimulant medications is prevalent (~47-60%), and the misuse of prescribed stimu- lants is increasing among youth (~5-34%), which poses a serious public health concern. Without adequate monitoring support by parental caregivers, stimulant misuse and non-adherence in youth can increase the risk of substance use disorders, overdose, psychosis, and suicidality. There are no available evidence- based tools or interventions demonstrated to improve stimulant adherence and reduce misuse among youth with ADHD. Most adherence aids (e.g., medication reminder apps, 7-day pill organizers, smart pill caps) fail to ad- dress the potential misuse of stimulants as they cannot regulate medication access. Pill dispensers are effec- tive at improving medication safety and adherence, but they are designed for older adult/elderly patients, and they are not ideal for youth due to their large and heavy size. Our pilot data suggest that youth are concerned about stigma from others when using their medication, and the use of current dispensers could hinder adher- ence by potentially soliciting unwanted attention and triggering anticipated stigma (i.e., worry/concern about negative reactions from others). PillSmart™ is a primary prevention intervention that uses a novel, sleek, and discreet pill dispensing device (prototype developed) and mobile app (to be developed). PillSmart's pocket-sized pill dispenser aims to prevent misuse by securely storing medication and only dispensing the programmed dose at the scheduled time. PillSmart's interoperating mobile app aims to improve adherence and mitigate the parental burden by fa- cilitating remote supervision of the stimulant medication regimen. The overarching goal of this project is to de- velop PillSmart's system as an evidence-based prevention intervention to improve stimulant adherence in youth with ADHD, reduce the parental burden of stimulant medication management, and in the long- term, reduce the non-medical use of prescribed stimulants. This Phase I study will now develop the system's interoperability between the dispenser and the app, conduct usability testing of the system, and conduct a prospective single-arm clinical trial to determine feasibili- ty. We hypothesize that the PillSmart™ system will improve medication adherence, prevent non-medical use of stimulant medication, and reduce anticipated stigma in youth. A subsequent phase II study will conduct a multi- site randomized clinical trial among youth prescribed with stimulants and will integrate evidence-based behav- ioral approaches to determine whether PillSmart™ is an adjunctive intervention that improves medication ad- herence and reduces non-medical use.",R43,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10259063,R43DA053121,R43DA053121-01A1,53121,A1,,2021,1,704,Leonie,,,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
1354,Healthy Aging: an EEG-based wearable device to accurately monitor sleep and enhance quality for improved cognitive functioning,"More than 40% of individuals as young as 60 start to experience some sort of cognitive decline. Among these, nearly one person in five develops mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a potential precursor of severe neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and dementia. Today, AD and dementia represent an economic burden of $277 B/year in the U.S. alone. Nothing can be done to cure or slow down them and drug development has failed so far - big pharma companies are quitting research in this field. Notwithstanding, life expectancy is rising. By 2050 the number of dementia cases will triple, and 13.2 million Americans will live with AD. Therefore, finding alternative interventions to slow down cognitive decline is an urgent priority and a necessary answer to an unmet need. Age-related decline in memory performance has been linked to the age-related reduction of deep sleep, or Slow Wave sleep (SWS). Interestingly, this represents a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline. We previously demonstrated the ability to enhance declarative memory in older adults by manipulating SWS for one night, in a laboratory environment, through non-invasive acoustic stimulation. The key is in the timing of acoustic stimulation, which is based on real-time analysis of EEG signal and aims at amplifying the single slow wave. However, it must be verified whether this acoustic stimulation can be comfortably tolerated when administered for many consecutive nights and whether memory enhancement shows a cumulative effect. To this extent, with this SBIR phase I project, we plan to bring our technology from the laboratory environment to the home-base settings. In particular, we aim to 1) Realize and validate a wearable headband, suitable for at-home-use, capable to detect the SWS upstate from EEG signal in real-time, and to deliver, accordingly, an acoustic stimulation. 2) Test user experience of the new device in healthy and MCI adults aged 60 and older. 3) Examine cumulative memory enhancement in these subjects upon delivery of acoustic stimulation for 7 consecutive nights. The successful outcomes of this project will open the way to the realization of the first wearable for cognitive training, based on safe manipulation of sleep via EEG-controlled acoustic stimulation. By improving memory performance during sleep, the proposed approach has the potential to dramatically delay or prevent the onset of age-related cognitive decline. In the long run, the benefit of our system may be further extended to slowing down progression of neurodegenerative disorders such AD and dementia.",R43,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10076067,R43AG065104,R43AG065104-01A1,65104,A1,,2020,1,705,Audie,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1358,Utilizing mHealth Technology to Support Caregivers in the Medical Management of their Child with Cancer,"A diagnosis of cancer in a child is a life-altering event not just for the patient, but also for their caregivers. A child's diagnosis of cancer multiplies the demands placed on caregivers and they often feel ill equipped to handle these activities, particularly if there are unmet information, communication, or resource needs. This can lead caregivers to experience physical stress, negative emotions, financial burden, and undesirable behavioral and physiological impacts. Ultimately, this can reduce caregivers' quality of life, which may impact their ability to provide appropriate medical care to their children. Due to the important role caregivers play, researchers have embarked on the development of supportive interventions to alleviate caregiver burden and facilitate coping and quality care. Van Houtven et al created the Caregiver Intervention Organizing Framework to align and advance caregiver focused oncology research. This framework postulates that interventions to improve a caregiver's clinical skills/knowledge, psychosocial (self-efficacy and coping) competency, support seeking (organizational and coordination), and/or quantity of caregiving will lead to benefits for both them and the patient with cancer. To date though, most caregiver focused interventions have been targeted at caregivers of adults with cancer, completely ignoring the unique needs of caregivers of children with cancer. Therefore, using the Van Houtven framework as a guide, we propose to develop a pediatric oncology caregiver focused intervention. This intervention will be delivered in the form of a mobile health information technology (mHealth) tool. mHealth, defined as the application of mobile or wireless communication technologies to health and healthcare, has great potential to assist caregivers in navigating the healthcare system and support them in the medical management of their children. Caregivers believe that technology can help them to make caregiving more efficient, effective, safer and less stressful. Our hypothesis is that an mHealth tool that aims to support caregivers in their ability to provide medical care to their child with cancer will lead to improvements in their sense of self-efficacy, mastery of caregiving skills/knowledge, and will reduce stress, which will ultimately result in improvement of both caregiver and patient-centered outcomes. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to: (1) Co-design and perform usability testing of an mHealth tool to address the medical management needs of caregivers of children with cancer utilizing a user-centered design process; and (2) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the mHealth tool for caregivers of children with cancer, assessing a) feasibility of caregiver use over extended period of time, b) acceptability of the mHealth tool by caregivers in a real-world setting, c) impact of the mHealth tool on caregiver outcomes, and d) effect on healthcare utilization of the child with cancer. Following this work, I will be well positioned to apply for R01 funding to conduct a larger-scale randomized controlled trial that further evaluates the impact of the caregiver focused mHealth tool on caregiver outcomes, as well as patient outcomes including clinical outcomes, quality of life, and healthcare utilization.",K08,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9821105,K08CA230218,K08CA230218-01A1,230218,A1,,2019,1,707,Audie,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
1364,Bilateral Closed Loop Deep Brain Stimulation for Freezing of Gait using Neural and Kinematic Feedback,"Gait impairment and Freezing of gait (FOG), lead to falls, injury (even death), loss of independent living, and are common in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), affecting over 7 million people worldwide. The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases increases with age and as the population lives longer, the societal consequences of FOG, will be very significant. Gait impairment and FOG have a partial response to medication and subthalamic nucleus (STN) open loop deep brain stimulation (olDBS), which cannot adjust therapy in response to underlying brain signals or motor symptoms such as FOG. One reason is that FOG may respond to different parameters of DBS, such as lower frequency, than that needed for tremor and most patients do not tolerate 60 Hz DBS for long periods of time. Emerging technology using sensing neurostimulators and Bluetooth enabled wearable sensors has allowed research into closed loop or adaptive (a)DBS using neural or behavioral control variables. FOG is episodic and usually occurs in predictable environments, so it is well suited for 'on demand' aDBS. ADBS, responding to markers of gait impairment and intermittent FOG, with changes in DBS intensity or frequency, could then prevent FOG, falls and injury, while still treating other motor signs of PD. From over four years of research and regulatory experience in an academic-industry collaboration with Medtronic, we have provided design inputs for the next generation aDBS devices, and have determined that aDBS for tremor and bradykinesia is safe and tolerable in the largest freely-moving PD cohort implanted with a Medtronic investigative neurostimulation/sensing system (Activa® PC+S-Nexus D/D3/E). We have discovered neural and behavioral markers of gait impairment and FOG using synchronized neural and kinematic recordings during gait tasks that elicit FOG. Our research findings and the technological advances embedded in the Medtronic Summit® RC+S-system now enable the next step: the first clinical studies of lateralized, independent, bilateral STN aDBS control algorithms for FOG in PD, driven by subject-specific neural (Aim 1) or behavioral (Aim 2) control variables, and in response to medication (Aim 3). The project will translate stepwise in a 'bench to bedside' manner, testing aDBS during the stepping in place (SIP) task, where the subject is in a harness and steps in place on dual force-plates. Then aDBS will be tested during the forward walking Turning and Barrier Course, which mimics environments known to trigger FOG in the real world, and then how aDBS responds to subject-specific doses of medication, while freely moving. The outcome of these experiments will provide critical next-steps for safety and feasibility of testing aDBS for gait impairment and FOG in the subject's home environment, and on their normal medication. Patient safety, tolerability, adverse effects, gait parameters, and the number and duration of freezing episodes (FEs), during no DBS, olDBS, aDBS and a control, intermittent (i)olDBS will provide inputs for future devices and novel algorithms applicable to NaDBS or KaDBS for gait impairment and FOG in other neurological diseases.",UH3,NS,NINDS,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9729333,UH3NS107709,UH3NS107709-01A1,107709,A1,,2019,1,710,Leonie,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
1365,"Sleep, Energetic Behaviors, and Adolescent Obesity during the Transition from Middle to High School","Jonathan Mitchell is an epidemiologist whose research aims to explain variations in childhood growth patterns. His long-term career goal is to lead a program of biobehavioral research to test how behaviors and genes combine to affect body composition and the development of obesity during adolescence. His work will help to inform childhood obesity prevention and promote healthy bone development. This career development award will provide him with training in sleep and he will develop expert knowledge on the integrated relationships between sleep, dietary intakes and physical activity in childhood. He will also receive training on the genetics of childhood obesity and bone mass, and this will enable him to lead gene-environment interaction studies. Finally, he will receive expert training on the methodologies used to measure body composition in the lab setting so that he can specifically estimate adiposity and bone mass in his research studies. His development in these areas will be achieved through a series of training activities and a research project, guided by an interdisciplinary team of senior scientists with expertise in sleep, genetics, nutrition, physicl activity, and body composition. He will complete coursework and attend seminars at the University of Pennsylvania that will cover sleep, nutrition, and obesity research. He will collaborate with members of his mentoring team to complete laboratory rotations and independent studies on sleep measurement, body composition measurement, and the genetics of body composition. He will complete short courses that cover physical activity research and longitudinal data analysis, and he will attend annual scientific meetings hosted by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (SLEEP), the American Heart Association (Epidemiology and Prevention/Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health [EPI/Lifestyle]), and the Obesity Society (Obesity Week). He will lead a research project that will use resources at the University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The research project aims to investigate the association between sleep, adolescent obesity and energy intake and physical activity. He will recruit a sample of 100 healthy adolescents aged 13 to 14 (8th grade) at baseline and will re-assess these adolescents at 1-year follow-up (9th grade. The participants have already been genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), representing obesity susceptibility loci, at the Center for Applied Genomics at CHOP. At both time points, he will provide each participant with two accelerometers; one will be worn for 24 hours per day for 2-weeks on the wrist to estimate total sleep time (TST). The second will be worn on the hip during waking hours for 2-weeks to estimate time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behavior (SB). During the 2-week wear periods trained Nutrition Core staff will call each participant on three occasions to record foods consumed in the past 24 hours; these data will be used to estimate energy intakes. Each participant will visit the CTRC Nutrition Core to have his or her fat mass estimated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). He hypothesizes that: 1) declines in TST will be associated with higher fat mass, 2) declines in TST will be associated with increased energy intake, and 3) declines in TST will be associated with less time spent in MVPA and more time spent in SB.

1366,Network Psychiatry: Using Network Science to Advance Our Understanding of Post-Bereavement Psychopathology,"Bereavement is a potent and ubiquitous stressor. More than 10 million individuals experience the death a loved one each year in the United States, increasing risk for numerous psychiatric disorders, including complicated grief. Despite the substantial burden conferred by these disorders, we know little about their nature and etiology and, consequently, are limited in our ability to predict, prevent, and treat post-bereavement psychopathology. Recently, my colleagues and I proposed that bereavement-related mental disorders, such as complicated grief, are best understood as complex systems of mutually reinforcing symptoms. In two studies, we used the tools of network science to study the structure of the complicated grief symptom network. These studies allowed us to identify which symptoms are most central to the complicated grief network and provided some of the earliest evidence that understanding network topology can inform our understanding of the course of complicated grief. My core aim for this career development award is to become an expert in network science and to use the tools of network science to study complicated grief as a complex psychobiological system. The proposed research study will build on our previous research through four critical innovations. First, we will use intensive time-series data to estimate the intra-individual network structure for each patient, providing information about the unique psychobiological processes operating within that individual. Second, we will focus our analyses on the elements of the complicated grief syndrome that align with bereavement-related Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs, linking our analyses to the broader effort to understand these individual components of psychopathology. Third, we will incorporate biological units of analysis into our intra-individual network and study how individual differences in physiological reactivity contribute to the complicated grief syndrome. Fourth, we will use intra-individual network parameters to predict the course of complicated grief over time. The approach taken in this study is innovative because it adopts a novel conceptual framework for understanding and studying psychiatric disorders that is rooted in the rapidly growing multi-disciplinary field of network science. It is significant because it will elucidate the patient-specific psychobiological mechanisms contributing to the development and onset of bereavement-related mental disorders. Moreover, it will introduce new tools into the field of psychiatry that will allow us to better predict, prevent, and treat psychopathology at the level of the individual patient, moving us closer to the aim of a precision medicine approach to psychiatry.",K23,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9526754,K23MH113805,K23MH113805-01A1,113805,A1,,2018,1,711,Tom,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,

NC ranks #32 in the United States for health outcomes and is ranked the fifth-worst state for health care with alarming racial health disparities in infant mortality, diabetes, kidney disease, and many chronic and acute conditions. The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) Research Centers at Minority Institutions (RCMI) has successfully and effectively engaged underserved communities. This proposal aims to establish an RCMI-led Clinical Research Network for Health Equity (CRNHE) to address gaps in clinic-based research and improve health care for uninsured patients. This innovative CRNHE called as NCCU RCMI Practice-Based Equity Research Network (PBERN) will bring together college student health clinic, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), free and charitable clinics, and local public health departments, all of which extensively serve uninsured and vulnerable populations. The three specific aims for the UG3 planning phase entail constructing the PBERN. The Administrative core (Admin Core) will oversee and manage the PBERN including formation of a patient/community advisory board and an external advisory committee of providers, craft a charter for the consortium, and memoranda of understanding for partner practices (SA1). The Community Engagement Core (CEC) will aim to integrate voices of the community, patients, and providers through consortium activities and develop community-recommended health awareness and prevention programs using the NCCU mobile health units (SA2). The Clinical Research Implementation Core (CRIC) will provide training in clinical and health services research methods and support consortium members in areas such as biostatistics, data science and survey design (SA3). The CRIC will also partner with commercial population health management platform, to design and plan for electronic health record (EHR) integration (during UH3 phase) across network clinics. During the second (UH3) phase, the CRIC will implement a rigorous and competitive pilot project program (2 pilots for 2-3 years) and offer rapid cycle vouchers (RCV) (3-6 months) for quality improvement and implementation science projects (SA4) and execute plans for EHR integration, data storage and analytics for consortium members to accelerate integrated health services research, and measure and report population health metrics (SA5). The Evaluation and Dissemination Unit (EDU) will continuously assess and work closely with the 2 cores (CRIC, CEC) and RCMI Coordinating Center to develop common metrics and make recommendations to public agencies for successful findings (SA6).

1375,Influence of Nighttime Interruptions on Sleep and Function of Patients following TBI,"In the U.S. nearly 275,000 people are hospitalized for traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year and with hospitalization, the TBI patient encounters a care environment that is not always supportive of recovery. As a part of the clinical care continuum, intermediate-care is the last rung of inpatient hospitalization and is often where an interdisciplinary team evaluates a patient's recovery from brain injury. The environment of care can be a barrier or facilitator to recovery post-TBI because it influences physiologic processes such as sleep. In patients with TBI intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to sleep disturbance Extrinsic factors like hospital noise, timing and exposure to light, and nighttime awakenings by hospital staff are noted as salient problems in both hospitalized patients and patients with TBI. However the available literature on sleep disturbance of patients with TBI housed in the intermediate care unit is sparse. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study is to examine the pattern of the patient's sleep fragmentation together with environmental stimuli in order to describe the influence of the care environment on the intermediate-care patient with TBI. The patients number of nighttime awakenings will be recorded using actigraphy while environmental factors (sound, light, and contact (as part of care-provision) will be recorded with a sound level meter and a multipurpose sensor, respectively. Additionally, multilevel modeling analyses will be used describe associations of the patient's nighttime awakenings, environmental factors, and the change in functional status (measured with functional independence measure, FIM) measured at day 1, day 5, and at discharge from intermediate care.",F31,NR,NINR,NR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,6,1,No,Awarded,9052446,F31NR015715,F31NR015715-01A1,15715,A1,,2015,1,688,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1378,Long-Term Observational Extension of Participants in the CREST-2 Randomized Clinical Trial,"CREST-2 (clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT02089217) is a pair of parallel, actively recruiting procedural trials to prevent stroke comparing: 1) carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and intensive medical management (IMM) to IMM alone, and 2) carotid artery stenting (CAS) and IMM to IMM alone. CREST-2 is designed to have ≈3-year average follow-up (maximum, 4 years). 1,735 patients have been randomized as of 10/29/2020. CREST-2 IMM involves centralized iterative titration to maximum tolerated effect of medications to treat hypertension and hyperlipidemia. We have already demonstrated that CREST-2 IMM results in significant improvements in rates of vascular risk factor control. We propose a highly cost-efficient, centralized process involving telephone and telehealth visits and review of medical records to monitor for stroke endpoints and home health visits to monitor control of vascular risk factors after patients graduate from CREST-2 to assess rigorously the transferability and real-world long-term effectiveness of intensive medical management with or without carotid revascularization. Our proposed long-term observational extension (LOE) is significant regardless of the CREST-2 results. If revascularization fails to show superiority (i.e., if IMM-only treatment is superior or not significantly different), proponents of revascularization will argue that the average follow-up was not sufficiently long to document the benefit of the procedure. The intersection of risk curves in the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study, which supported benefit of CEA compared to medical management, was noted at ≈2 years following study entry. Contemporary IMM likely pushes the point of intersection outward. If revascularization is shown to be superior in CREST-2, then the durability of the benefit of revascularization beyond the 3-year average follow-up will be questioned due to possible restenosis. We propose obtaining written informed consent on all CREST-2 patients for continued follow-up for an additional 5 years, providing a 7.5-year average follow-up, with a subset of patients followed to >10 years. Cost-effectiveness will be achieved through innovative follow-up methodology. Our approach is also designed to minimize patient burden and maximize retention. The primary aim of this proposal is estimation of post- procedure treatment differences between revascularization and IMM vs. IMM alone. The currently funded CREST-2 trial will provide data on post-procedure treatment differences up to ≈3 years. Extending follow-up will enable us to assess whether post-procedure benefit is maintained during intermediate (4-6 years) and long-term follow-up (7-10 years); thereby, testing durability. The primary outcome for the CREST-2 LOE is the composite of stroke and death within 44 days after randomization and ischemic stroke ipsilateral to the randomized vessel thereafter. Our LOE approach is significant because it can be applied to a wide variety of stroke prevention trials where the therapeutic intervention is a device or procedure.",U01,NS,NINDS,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10294280,U01NS119169,U01NS119169-01A1,119169,A1,,2021,1,717,Chris,,,,,,,,,
1389,Interaction of sleep disturbance and anxiety symptoms in the neural and psychophysiological responses to fear conditioning and extinction in Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"Epidemiological studies show that preexisting insomnia increases the odds of incident anxiety disorders and vice versa. We have suggested that preexisting sleep disturbance can disrupt sleep-dependent emotion regulatory circuits, such as those supporting consolidation of fear extinction memory, leading, in turn, to greater daytime anxiety symptoms. Exacerbation of both sleep disruption and anxiety symptoms can then occur via a positive feedback (""vicious cycle"") mechanism. The proposed research will test this 3- component mutual-reinforcement model in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), the anxiety disorder most commonly comorbid with Insomnia Disorder (ID). In a sample of individuals with GAD having varying degrees of sleep disturbance, we will measure associations between each pair of the above elements - 1) sleep quality, 2) extinction memory and its associated neural substrates and 3) GAD symptomatology - to determine whether such associations support this positive feedback model. In a recent fMRI study comparing individuals with Primary Insomnia (PI) to age and sex-matched good sleeping healthy controls (HC) and individuals with GAD, we have identified two factors that might predispose persons with ID to develop GAD. First, using resting state functional connectivity, we found that individuals with PI showed connectivity between the left amygdala and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (a region believed to regulate amygdala activity) that was both significantly less than HC and intermediate between that of HC and individuals with GAD. Thus emotion regulation may be weakened in PI thereby increasing vulnerability to GAD. Second, using a validated 2-day fear conditioning and extinction protocol, we identified delayed engagement of extinction-related structures in PI relative to HC. In HC, activation of extinction-related structures (ventromedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) occurred during extinction learning, but did not do so in PI until extinction recall 24 h later. Research will examine 50 individuals with GAD half of whom can be diagnosed with comorbid ID and half of whom will not meet criteria for ID. Following psychiatric and sleep-disorders screening interviews, participants will complete 14 days of longitudinal actigraph and sleep-diary monitoring, an online battery of anxiety and sleep quality assessments, three nights of ambulatory polysomnography and two fMRI scanning sessions. fMRI will consist of both resting state scans and the above fear conditioning and extinction protocol with simultaneous measurement of skin conductance. The three components of the positive feedback model will be analyzed from both a categorical (GAD with vs. without co-morbid ID) and a dimensional perspective that accords with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria approach. General hypotheses tested will be 1) that co-morbid insomnia in GAD worsens behavioral and neural aspects of fear extinction as well as resting state-connectivity between fear expression and emotion regulatory structures, and 2) that poor sleep quality, poor extinction memory and greater GAD symptomatology show the predicted mutual exacerbation predicted by the positive feedback model.",R21,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9601467,R21MH115279,R21MH115279-01A1,115279,A1,,2018,1,695,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1400,Modeling mood course to detect markers for effective adaptive interventions,"Bipolar (BP) disorder is a chronic illness of profound shifts in mood ranging from mania to depression. BP is successfully treated by combining medication with psychosocial therapy, but care can prove inadequate in practice. With gaps in coverage and medication, along with imprecise guidelines on when, where, and how to intervene, promising psychosocial therapies require adaptive strategies to better address the specific needs of individuals in a timely manner (NIMH Strategy 2). To accomplish this, however, requires evidence-based practices for adapting a psychosocial therapy. This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award aims to address this knowledge gap, by (1) establishing a mobile health platform for translating a psychosocial therapy in BP into an effective adaptive intervention and (2) facilitating the transition of a junior researcher, at the interface of mathematics and psychiatry, into an independent researcher of effective adaptive interventions. The research effort is founded on a mobile health platform that combines evidence-based markers of mood for long-term monitoring with a micro-randomized trial, designed for optimizing mobile health adaptive interventions. In Aim 1, we use modeling to characterize and test new markers of mood course that account for volatility, a feature that masks effects of a therapy on mood. In Aim 2, we explore the potential for long-term monitoring of BP with interpretable markers from actigraphy. In Aim 3, best practices from Aim 1 and 2 are integrated with a micro-randomized trial into a mobile health platform. We then test the feasibility of using the platform to translate a psychosocial therapy, clinical phone call, into an adaptive intervention. If successful, this work will advance the Candidate's independent goal of adaptive scheduling of phone-calls with BP individuals. To complement the research agenda, the award will expand the Candidate's background in Computational Psychiatry into the area of Translational Psychiatry by providing training in five strategic areas: (1) clinical assessments, (2) psychosocial therapy, (3) mobile health interventions, (4) adaptive clinical trials, and (5) open-access scheduling. Dr. Melvin McInnis, Thomas B and Nancy Upjohn Woodworth Professor of Bipolar Disorder and Depression and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Michigan, will be the primary mentor and will guide clinical aspects of the training (Training Objectives 1-3); Dr. Amy Kilbourne, Professor of Psychiatry and Acting Director of VA/HSR&D's Quality Enhancement Research Initiative, will guide training in the application of adaptive trial designs that involve psychosocial therapy (Training Objectives 2,4-5); and Dr. Susan Murphy, Herbert E. Robbins Distinguished Professor of Statistics, will guide training into methodology for adaptive trial design and mobile health interventions (Training Objectives 3-4). The proposed K01 award promises to train a junior scholar to address technically-challenging problems in mental health.

1402,Low-burden Adaptive Mobile Interventions for Mood and Suicide Risk,"Depression is the #1 cause of disease-related disability worldwide and prevalence rates for depression and suicide have increased significantly in the United States over the past 25 years. Young adults, including college students, have especially high rates of depression, yet a majority of individuals with clinically significant symptoms do not seek formal treatment. Previous work by the Candidate (Dr. Adam Horwitz) suggests that college students at elevated risk for suicide may decline formal treatment due to barriers such as lack of time, low perceived need for treatment, or limited access to services. Mobile health technologies offer promising new opportunities to overcome these barriers and improve outcomes. Further, the use of mobile technologies in combination with wearable sensors allow for the gathering of real-time subjective and objective data, and an ability to respond to mood changes directly with an intervention at the time it is needed. This K23 Mentored Career Development Award application proposes a program of focused research and training to facilitate the Candidate's transition to an independent career in patient-oriented research with a specialization in low-burden adaptive mobile preventative interventions for mood and suicide risk. The specific research aims are to: 1) using a participatory action approach, identify the target population preferences, barriers to engagement, and relevant domains for ecological momentary assessments and personalized feedback messages; and 2) conduct a pilot feasibility micro-randomized trial of a mobile health personalized feedback intervention with college students (N = 60) at risk for depressive episodes. The Candidate will pursue these research aims by obtaining specific training to gain expertise in: 1) participatory action research methods for intervention development; 2) mHealth, micro-randomized trials, and adaptive mobile intervention development and evaluation; and 3) advanced statistical analysis for mobile, sensor, and ecological momentary assessment data. These training objectives will be met through close mentorship from experts in these content areas, specialized trainings and didactics, and applied research experiences. Findings from the outlined investigations will provide invaluable pilot data regarding acceptability, feasibility, perceived helpfulness, and hypothesized mechanisms of change, as well as potential features and thresholds that can be used as intervention triggers in an adaptive design. Together, these findings will directly inform an NIH R01 application at the conclusion of the study period seeking to evaluate a just-in-time adaptive intervention designed to optimize the delivery of personalized feedback messages, and provide additional coping tips, tools, and/or resources when indicated. In summary, the training and research opportunities outlined in this proposal will provide the necessary skills for a promising Candidate to launch a career in developing accessible and impactful adaptive mobile interventions to reduce depression and suicide among young people.",K23,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10569278,K23MH131761,K23MH131761-01,131761,,,2022,1,730,Tom,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
1423,"Sleep-wake, cognitive, and affective risks for a worse course of post-discharge suicidal ideation in older adults with major depression","Our archival data indicates that 27% of older adults hospitalized with major depression and suicidality continue to report suicidal ideation (SI) three months after discharge. Having persistent post- discharge SI places individuals at very high risk for suicidal behaviors and death. Cognitive and affective mechanisms likely determine the course of post-discharge SI, but interrupting these processes remains challenging. This is, in part, because the upstream modifiable risk factors that exacerbate problems with cognition, affect, and SI in the post-discharge period are poorly understood. We propose that sleep-wake disturbances are potentially important contributors to the post-discharge prognosis. Sleep-wake disturbances plausibly influence the cognitive and affective mechanisms that underlie SI. But many potentially relevant sleep-wake factors have been identified, and there is not yet evidence regarding which mark or drive the mechanisms that perpetuate SI after discharge. To begin filling these gaps, we propose a prospective observational pilot study examining sleep-wake disturbances, alongside other putative suicide risk factors, in the critical post-discharge period. This Exploratory/Developmental Research (R21) proposal brings together experts in sleep-wake rhythms and late-life depression (Smagula, PhD, PI), sleep medicine (Buysse, MD), late- life suicide (Szanto, MD, Co-I), cognitive aging (Butters, PhD), and time series analytics (Krafty, PhD, Co-I). We will monitor the course of suicidality over 12-weeks in 70 adults (age 55-75, with non-psychotic major depressive disorder, current active SI, and a recent psychiatric hospital discharge). Over 6 weeks, we will perform high-resolution data collection including: assessing 24-hour sleep-wake patterns (using actigraphy and diary); measuring daily suicidality levels (passive ideation, active ideation, and planning) and affect (depression and anxiety); and administering weekly home-based tests of cognitive functions previously linked with sleep and suicide (i.e., attention, response inhibition, and reversal learning performance). Our testable hypotheses based on existing evidence are that: (1) weekly measures of short sleep duration and sleep-wake rhythm disruption will temporally precede and independently predict a worse course of post-discharge SI; and (2) these sleep-wake factors will relate to the course of SI, in part, via their adverse effects on cognition and affect. Given their important roles, we will also evaluate the effects of psychosocial factors and assess their relationships with sleep. Collecting these novel data will enable analyses: (1) ranking the effect sizes of putative risk factors including sleep-wake, psychosocial, affective, and cognitive measures; (2) examining the temporal relationships between risk factors; and (3) preliminarily testing mediational models. Results from this study will inform the development of confirmatory studies ultimately leading to novel, evidence-based, interventions. If sleep-wake factors have a role in determining post-discharge suicide risk, the potential for clinical translation is high, given that sleep-wake risks could be modified and/or monitored after discharge.",R21,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9974894,R21MH120511,R21MH120511-01A1,120511,A1,,2020,1,712,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1426,Technology Intervention to Support Caregiving for Alzheimer's Disease (I-CARE),"Informal caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) manage a complex spectrum of patient behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). BPSD are major contributing factors to caregivers' burden and adverse health outcomes, leading to an increase of unplanned hospitalizations and a decrease in quality of life. The National Alzheimer's Project Act recognizes the need for interventions that ""enable family caregivers to continue to provide care while maintaining their own health and well-being."" Furthermore, recommendations from 2015 and 2018 Alzheimer's Disease Research Summits include the application of technology to improve caregiving research and ADRD care. Our team has translated decades of research on nonpharmachological interventions to manage patient BPSD and caregiver burden into a fully operational and self-sustaining clinical service called the Aging Brain Care (ABC) clinical program. However, our evaluations show that the ABC clinical program and other similar clinical services are limited by: 1) the number and availability of clinical providers; 2) incomplete or delayed BPSD and informal caregiver burden assessment data to inform timely clinical interventions; and 3) inadequate support for caregiver engagement in BPSD management and self-care. To address these limitations, our research team developed a novel mobile health (mHealth) technology application called Brain CareNotes (BCN), which offers 24/7 support, assessment and longitudinal tracking of patient symptoms and caregiver burden, and engagement tools including a caregiver toolkit and secure bidirectional messaging with clinicians or trusted others. We propose a pilot randomized controlled trial, named the I-CARE trial, in which we will test the feasibility and estimate the effect of BCN, as an add-on intervention to ABC, on caregiver burden and patient BPSD. We will enroll 60 patient-caregiver dyads over a period of 15 months and randomize each dyad into a BCN+ABC intervention group or an ABC alone control group. Data will be collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months in both groups. We will assess primary feasibility outcome measures of recruitment rate, data completion, and BCN usability, acceptance, and use as well as secondary outcomes of caregiver burden and patient BPSD. Means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals will be computed to test feasibility hypotheses. Mixed linear models will be used to test hypotheses comparing the two conditions at 6 months. Informal caregiver burden and ADRD are both recognized as important public health problems. Improving our understanding on how to care for patients with ADRD and their informal caregivers is urgently needed.",R21,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9726278,R21AG062966,R21AG062966-01,62966,,,2019,1,742,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1452,Waterproof Leadless Armband For Continuous Wireless Monitoring For Atrial Fibrillation,"/ABSTRACT 2 (No longer than 30 lines of text) 3 Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained dysrhythmia worldwide. Although new AF 4 treatment strategies have emerged over the last decade, a major challenge facing clinicians and 5 researchers is the paroxysmal, often short-lived, and frequently asymptomatic nature of AF. Paroxysmal 6 and asymptomatic AF would be found in a growing percentage of our population if it were detectable, and 7 causes major long-term health consequences despite being so silent. There is, therefore, a pressing need to 8 develop an inexpensive device for long-term, continuous monitoring containing an accurate real-time AF 9 detection algorithm, to lower our nation's healthcare costs. Such a device would not only increase rates of 10 detection in symptomatic patients and allow for better evaluation of treatment efficacy, but could become 11 widely-adopted enough to flush out asymptomatic people, if coupled with a strong awareness campaign. 12 Given the ever-growing popularity of wearable devices, our approach to AF detection using leadless 13 wearable armbands and a smartphone app will give patients as well as health care providers the 14 opportunity to monitor for AF under the wide variety of conditions in a patient's real life. We want to make 15 a device the user can truly live in, long term. Because our approach does not involve ECG leads, it will be 16 minimally obtrusive, thereby leading to better acceptance and use by patients. Our wearable device has 17 the potential to disrupt the traditional delivery of AF healthcare. For this objective to be successfully 18 achieved, four key technology pillars must be commercialized. The first is an accurate AF detection 19 algorithm. The second is a reusable, rugged, flexible electrode material that does not cause skin irritation 20 with prolonged use in all real-world conditions. The third is an accurate motion artifact removal 21 algorithm. The fourth is leadless ECG capture. The first two technological developments have been 22 achieved by our company's CTO. Our AF algorithm has been shown to be accurate in multiple peer- 23 reviewed publications, and is now commercially available in a Holter monitor from Scottcare Corporation. 24 We have also developed novel waterproof, flexible, gel-less, reusable electrodes that do not cause skin 25 irritation. Hence, the objective of this SBIR project is to bring to maturity the last two pillar technologies. 26 Preliminary work on concepts for both show great promise. We believe this work will result in rapid 27 translation in later Phases into an innovative and disruptive AF detection product. The envisioned product 28 has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare costs by accurately and more succinctly establishing the 29 diagnosis of AF in at-risk groups, thereby providing clinicians with an opportunity to prevent expensive 30 secondary complications of these life-threatening arrhythmias.",R43,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9345612,R43HL135961,R43HL135961-01A1,135961,A1,,2017,1,755,Chris,,,,,,,,,
1460,mHealth for ART adherence by HIV+ African Americans age 45 & older,"Environment and Health Group (EHG), Inc., in collaboration with a number of Boston MA and Columbia SC based organizations, seeks to enhance, test, and commercialize an individually-tailored, culturally-sensitive, positive-psychology and behavioral-economics based, mobile health intervention to promote ART adherence, increase ART self-efficacy and reduce feelings of stress burden among HIV positive African Americans age 45 and older. African Americans represent a growing portion (41%) of people living with HIV (CDC, 2012; 2014); by 2015, those age 50+ will account for half of all cases of HIV/AIDS in the U.S. (NIDA, 2012). Poor ART adherence contributes to disparities in HIV/AIDS outcomes among older African Americans. The proposed project is based on EHG's previous research with HIV+, age 50 years and older, African American adults. That research revealed personalized pill reminder text messages with positive-psychology based motivational and educational messages are effective at addressing two major barriers to ART adherence in this group: 1) memory deficits resulting from the combined effects of HIV, cognitive aging, and increased allostatic load, and 2) low motivation due to lack of ART self efficacy and negative affect. Findings showed significant improvement in ART adherence scores and marginally significant improvement in ART self- efficacy scores. While affect scores did not change, qualitative findings showed the intervention helped reduce feelings of stress burden. Supporting ART adherence is key to reducing health disparities among HIV+ African Americans. Doing so for those, age 45 and older-who are most vulnerable to cumulative, age-accelerating effects of HIV infection and allostatic load-is urgent, which is why we are lowering the age cut-off from 50 to 45 in Phase II. To date, no ART adherence support intervention has been developed for this highly-vulnerable group. The Phase II project will enhance the existing mobile intervention by offering: 1) a two-way communication capability through which participants can: i) indicate ""pill taken"" in response to pill reminders, and ii) receive a positive visual icon as behavioral-economics based reinforcement for ""pill taken"" responses; 2) live, real-time pharmacist counseling and medication support; and, 3) the addition of opt-in smoking cessation educational and motivational texts. Overall aims are to: 1) expand mhealth intervention to incorporate new Phase II features; 2) evaluate effectiveness in an RCT of HIV+ African Americans age 45 and older; and 3) prepare marketing and commercialization plans. Our long-term goal is to increase ART adherence, thus decreasing health disparities, among HIV+, African-Americans, age 45+.",R44,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,9065147,R44MD007161,R44MD007161-03,7161,,,2016,3,759,Audie,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1464,Latinx Children and Surgery,"Over 60 million persons in the U.S. identify themselves as Latinx and 25.6% are children under the age of 16. Surgical disparities for adults and children have been identified as a major problem in the US and can be experienced at multiple points along a patient's health care trajectory. Data from our center indicates that a substantial portion of Latinx children who undergo surgery experience high anxiety and postoperative pain as well as postoperative impairments in psychological and physical functioning as compared to White non-Latin children who undergo surgery. Recent growth in use of mobile devices provides us an opportunity to create low- cost mHealth behavioral interventions to reduce this disparity in surgical outcomes. In a previous NIH award, the PI developed and tested an evidence based mHealth tailored intervention (WebTIPS) that aims to prepare and be a companion of a child and their family during a surgical event. WebTIPS aims to enhance the recovery of the child in several ways such as reducing anxiety and pain and is based on information provision, modeling, and teaching of coping skills. WebTIPS, however, was developed and validated with a population of primarily White non-Latinx English-speaking children and their parents. Unfortunately, it is well established that mHealth interventions are significantly less effective when used with specific ethnic minorities unless they underwent a process of cultural adaptation. Over the past 4-years, we have established multiple academic and community collaborations, conducted extensive participatory research with Latinx stakeholders and used the heuristic framework and a modified ecological validity model to culturally adapt WebTIPS. The culturally adapted intervention is called L-WebTIPS. The overall aim of this application is to reduce surgical disparities in a population of Latinx children undergoing surgery. The first phase of this application (R61) includes web programming of L-WebTIPS, conduct formative evaluation and conduct feasibly RCT to test this intervention. The second phase (R33) includes a multi-center RCT which aims to determine the effectiveness of L-WebTIPS compared to attention control intervention in decreasing postoperative pain, opioids consumption and lowering anxiety in Latinx children undergoing outpatient surgery. Secondary aims of the R33 include examining the impact of L-WebTIPS on home-based clinical recovery parameters such as pain, analgesic requirements, new onset behavioral changes and return to normal daily activity in Latinx children undergoing outpatient surgery. We also plan to determine if the use of L- WebTIPS reduces anxiety and improve experience among the parents of Latinx children undergoing surgery. Finally we plan to determine if the use of L-WebTIPS reduces anxiety and enhance experience among the parents of Latinx children undergoing surgery. We submit that using a cultural adaption process for an existing validated intervention will accelerate the process of reducing surgical disparities and bringing an effective intervention to clinical settings and routine use.",R61,MH,NIMH,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10538983,R61MH132249,R61MH132249-01,132249,,,2022,1,761,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1466,Perturbation training for enhancing stability and limb support control for fall-risk reduction among stroke survivors,"The long-term objective of this research is to develop an efficacious training paradigm to enhance stroke survivors' defense mechanisms against falls and possibly reduce healthcare cost. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the direct medical cost for fall related injuries to be $34 billion annually. Forty percent to 70% of community-dwelling stroke survivors experience detrimental falls each year and tend to have 1.5 to 4 times higher risk of hip fracture than their healthy counterparts; with only less than 40% of those individuals regaining independent mobility. Falls, thus not only affect activities of daily living but also reduce mobility, increase risk of second stroke and mortality. Despite potential financial and functional implications of falls in this population, health-care personnel are limited in their ability to develop and validate interventions to reduce fall-risk for them. Further emphasis is placed on locomotor training with focus on enhancing paretic limb function. The project design consists of a randomized controlled trial to examine the ability of chronic stroke survivors to acquire, generalize and retain adaptations to slip-perturbation training for not only mitigating fall risk but also improving walking function. It also explores translation of this paradigm to the sub-acute population. The paradigm is novel in that it targets contributions of the paretic vs. non-paretic limbs on fall-risk through a bilateral training paradigm that involves training the non-paretic side first and then paretic to facilitate acquisition of fall-prevention skills on the paretic side, which may otherwise take longer to acquire training effects. The longer-term benefits of such perturbation training, targeting both limbs for reducing falls will be assessed not only in the laboratory but also in real life via wearable sensors, along with improved community walking function. The hypothesis of this study if supported by the results will provide an evidence-supported training protocol to reduce the fall-risk not only in people living with hemiparetic stroke but also among survivors of other acquired unilateral cortical lesions.",R01,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9260665,R01HD088543,R01HD088543-01A1,88543,A1,,2016,1,762,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
1482,Therapeutic Drug Monitoring with a Wearable Ultrasound-based Sensor,"This research will develop wearable sensors analogous to the pulse oximeter, but to monitor heparin anticoagulation therapy and other drugs with a narrow therapeutic window. This work is exceptionally innovative and completely distinct from other work on therapeutic drug monitoring because it is sample-free, acoustics-based, non-invasive, and real-time. This approach is also the only design to measure the heparin/anti-thrombin complex in contrast to existing surrogate methods that simply measure clotting time. Although applicable to multiple drugs, we will focus on heparin because it is a cornerstone (500M doses/year) of surgical and cardiovascular medicine. Heparin has variable molecular weight, activity, biodistribution, and pharmacokinetics resulting in a narrow therapeutic window causing heparin to be the second most common medication error. The current standard for heparin monitoring is the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); however, this in vitro diagnostic tool suffers from long turnaround times, a variable reference range, and poor correlation to outcome. To solve this, I will develop novel wearable ultrasound-based sensors. In particular, I will use photoacoustic imaging-a hybrid approach that uses incident light pulses to trigger an acoustic signal. Its spectral nature, intense contrast, and high frame rate facilitates real-time, multiplexed, and high sensitivity measurements. These are ideal features for therapeutic drug monitoring. First, we will synthesize novel sensing molecules. We will then integrate these chemical sensors into wearable devices that will interact with ultrasound transducers to quantitate coagulation without venipuncture. In the final phases of the program, we will validate this approach with animal models and expand this to other drugs such as digoxin and phenytoin as well as multiplexed sensors. Rather than injecting a contrast agent and hoping it goes to the site of disease in vivo or drawing blood and processing it in vitro, this work will immobilize a sensor in situ for constant feedback on anticoagulation therapy. The confluence of imaging technology, wearable technology, and chemical technology that I offer here will truly revolutionize the incredibly common practice of heparin therapy-patients will no longer be subjected to invasive sampling and will avoid dangerous overdoses and underdoses. Doctors and nurses will have instantaneous feedback on their patients and smart infusion pumps will carefully and automatically titrate drug dosages. Long term, this work will translate into significant cost savings for insurers and providers.",DP2,HL,NHLBI,OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9165380,DP2HL137187,DP2HL137187-01,137187,,,2016,1,770,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
1492,"Hormonal, Metabolic and Signaling Interactions in PAH","Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension is a lethal disease with devastating impact on thousands of patients and families. Our team has studied this tragic disease for more than 3 decades and the progressive knowledge derived from that work now promises to greatly improve outcomes. Our overall theme is to develop and apply therapies which are directed against mechanisms central to Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). Our studies indicate that altered estrogen signalling, and defects in intracellular trafficking and insulin resistance, work independently and in concert to drive the vascular dysfunction characteristic of PAH. Our hypothesis is that focused treatment of the hormonal and metabolic derangements which underlie PAH will improve pulmonary vascular function and patient outcomes. Our renewal program includes 3 Projects and 2 Cores. Project 1 is continued from cycle 1 (Sex Hormones in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension). It explores exciting avenues derived from understanding the direct contribution of sex hormones to pathogenesis and risk by gender. We expect to confirm that estrogen inhibition with tamoxifen is safe and beneficial in PAH. Project 2 is also continued from cycle 1 (Metabolic Function in Pulmonary Vascular Disease) and emerges from our new understanding of the importance of disordered glucose control, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome as contributors to PAH. We expect to confirm that metformin and exercise are safe and beneficial in PAH, and to measure individual patient determinants of response. Project 3 is new (Genomic and Circulating Predictors of PAH response - Leader Anna Hemnes MD) which we developed with the goal to advance precision medicine in PAH, for which we are uniquely positioned. There exists a great unmet need for a scientific basis to tailor the treatment approach for PAH. Our longterm future goal is to optimize PAH therapy by understanding the individual determinants of response, for each of our experimental therapies (tamoxifen, metformin, ACE2) as well as approved agent classes (prostacyclins, endothelin blockers, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors). This is an ideal time to translate our successive progress in understanding PAH mechanisms, because the responsible pathways are targeted by approved drugs (tamoxifen, metformin) or exercise, which are safe and tolerable in humans, and our team is experienced and motivated. Neither the studies nor the interventions can be most effective without considering all aspects of the molecular bases of the disease, which is only possible in a highly interactive program such as that we propose here.",P01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,9355878,P01HL108800,P01HL108800-07,108800,,,2017,7,775,Audie,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,

The applicant will build towards this goal in several phases over the course of the award period, culminating in a pilot, randomized controlled trial that compares two intervention strategies, relative to a wait-list control condition, aimed at enhancing functional outcomes in recent-onset schizophrenia. In addition, the applicant will: 1) develop expertise in the neurocognitive and behavioral mechanisms that contribute to impaired motivation in schizophrenia; 2) learn how to conduct clinical trial in schizophrenia; 3) develop expertise in the development and implementation of novel mobile health interventions; and 4) acquire necessary skills in advanced statistical methods. The two aims of the research plan are: 1) To test the feasibility and acceptability of a Personalized Real- Time Intervention for Motivation Enhancement (PRIME); this intervention for young individuals with schizophrenia aims to improve psychosocial functioning by increasing their aspiration to initiate and attain health-promoting goals (i.e., to target their wanting deficits), and a combination of PRIME and a computer- based Plasticity-Assisted Cognitive Remediation (PACR) program; which will target higher order cognitive processes associated with goal persistence (learning deficits), 2) The applicant will conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial comparing the potential efficacy of PRIME and PRIME + PACR, relative to participants in a wait-list control condition.

1500,Codevelopment of Sensory and Motor Function in Infants At Risk for Cerebral Palsy,"Infants born prematurely (gestational age <32 weeks) are at risk (AR) for cerebral palsy (CP). CP is the most common pediatric movement disorder and is caused by damage to brain areas during development. Children with CP have motor and sensory impairments that cause muscle weakness, poor coordination, and difficulty grasping objects. These impairments prevent functional independence and reduce social participation. How these impairments arise throughout the course of life is not well understood. This is due in part to a limited understanding of how sensory and motor systems interact during development to organize brain circuits. The gap in knowledge is particularly problematic because the timing of motor and sensory brain area establishment (i.e. during the first year of life) coincides with a period in which the brain is highly plastic. Interventions for infants with CP are emerging, but little is known about the neural systems that can be targeted to optimize these novel interventions. We will longitudinally track infant movements and sensory function in relation to brain development in typically developing infants and infants AR for CP. By characterizing the development of sensorimotor function and brain activation patterns, we will identify key mechanisms of motor recovery. Understanding mechanisms of motor and sensory development during this age could provide potential targets for activity-dependent interventions at a time when the nervous systems is highly malleable. Thus, this project will provide novel insights aligned with the NINDS mission of advancing fundamental knowledge about the brain to improve treatments for neurological disease. My long-term goal is to develop a program of research that uses mechanistic information to develop evidence-based therapies that improve function in infants with CP. To accomplish this goal, I have developed a rigorous career development plan under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in content areas directly related to my training goals. My career development activities will focus on: 1) obtaining pragmatic professional development experiences to accelerate my career path, 2) developing expertise in integrated measurements of sensorimotor behavior and brain activity in infants, and 3) acquiring a strong foundation in clinical design and quantitative analyses for longitudinal studies.

1508,Creating Live Interactions to Mitigate Barriers (CLIMB): A Mobile Intervention to Improve Social Functioning in People With Schizophrenia,"The goal of the current Phase I project is to develop (to clinical trial readiness) and evaluate feasibility of a mobile ecological momentary intervention designed to improve social functioning in individuals with schizophrenia. While effective treatments such as group-based social skills training and computerized social cognition training are known to induce positive effects on lab-based measures of social, community and occupational functioning, no approaches currently monitor and facilitate the generalization of acquired skills in real-world settings. Mobile technology offers many advantages over clinic-based approaches, in that it enables real-time evaluation, interaction, and support within the individual's natural environment, thus facilitating skill transfer. Additionally, it improves access, expands reach, and targets underserved vulnerable individuals who are unable to access these specialized programs. In our preliminary work, we developed and demonstrated the feasibility of a newly designed mobile psychosocial intervention called CLIMB (Creating Live Interactions to Mitigate Barriers). CLIMB integrates computerized social cognition training with optimized remote social skills training, and is delivered entirely remotely using mobile platforms. Our preliminary data suggest that CLIMB resulted in good retention, engagement, and acceptability rates, and remediated social cognitive and quality of life impairments. In this proposal, we will first implement the current intervention with innovative features, including ecological momentary assessments, weekly self-reports, interactive training and evaluation modules, and a clinician dashboard. Next, we will evaluate the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the revised intervention with the target population. At the completion of this project we will have outcomes data sufficient to support a large scale randomized controlled trial in Phase II (medical device trial) designed to establish medical claims defining the efficacy of this intervention to enhance social functioning for schizophrenia. At the completion of Phase II, we expect to be able to complete the FDA regulatory pathway, clear the program as the first technology- based medical device intended for the enhancement of social functioning in schizophrenia, and have the opportunity to improve the lives of millions of people suffering from this condition.",R43,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9467150,R43MH114765,R43MH114765-01A1,114765,A1,,2018,1,783,Chris,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1512,Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,"One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.",R01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9284636,R01CA215318,R01CA215318-01,215318,,,2017,1,785,Josh,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
1526,Development of a Wearable Band-Aid Biosensor System for Alcohol Monitoring,"The goal of this Phase I SBIR is to develop a non-invasive wearable dermal device (""Band-Aid"") capable of extracting and sensing ethanol from interstitial space using reverse iontophoresis (not sweat!) and transmitting the results wirelessly to a Bluetooth™ capable device. The proposed band-aid patch will be easily applied to the epidermis, and will provide monitoring of ethanol levels in a cost-effective, discreet form factor that is readily disguised under clothing. The device will be inconspicuous when applied by the end-user leading to enhanced usage and compliance. Our approach is based on our existing biosensor platform which is readily adaptable to meet the deliverables of this proposal. Our technology has an exceptionally small footprint, is cheap to manufacture, and is designed to communicate via Bluetooth™ protocols. The patch has five independent potentiostat circuits built into the device that allow for averaging of the ethanol reading. These five sensors result in a ""voting scheme"" that reduces false positives and false negatives which often plague other ethanol sensing modalities, most especially sweat sensors. The extension of the existing platform to a ""band-aid"" patch form factor based on reverse iontophoretic sampling represents a next generation approach to non-invasive analyte detection and monitoring. As part of this effort, we will re-engineer AOx into a next-generation enzyme with enhanced activity and stability profiles specifically designed for use in diagnostic devices. Our approach is based on Design-Zyme's proven platform for oxidase enzyme stabilization. This is a novel undertaking, as this approach has not been specifically used to enhance the performance of AOx. This approach to enzyme re-engineering is unique and innovative in the diagnostic field and will positively impact the performance of the final Phase II device. During Phase I of this SBIR, we will demonstrate that the prototype device shows a linear response to ethanol in vitro and preliminary in vivo rodent models. During Phase II, we will optimize the device sampling, sensitivity, calibration and lifetime, its manufacturing process, and demonstrate the device utility in a number of animal models. The goal at the end of Phase II is to have an optimized device that can be deployed in animal models and be ready for human clinical trials. Design-Zyme LLC will take the lead on this project with the goal of rapidly developing the wearable ethanol sensor for commercialization. Design-Zyme LLC has established itself as a manufacturer of high-quality, high- purity, high-activity stabilized enzymes for monitoring and biosensing applications and a commercialization entity for wearable sensors. The Design-Zyme LLC and Caltech teams have made several significant advancements towards the development wearable sensors based on cutting edge electronics and that incorporate stabilized proteins for enhanced performance.

1546,Music-based Intervention for Insomnia in Persons Living with Dementia and their Caregivers,"Insomnia symptoms (i.e., difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep) in persons living with Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias are debilitating and contribute to increased institutionalization, reduced cognitive function and accelerated disease progression. Furthermore, insomnia disruption is linked to poor health outcomes in caregivers, such as poor quality of life and increased burden. Given the potential harmful side effects of pharmacologic treatment, non-pharmacologic approaches, such as music, may provide a safer alternative to improving insomnia symptoms. Music interventions are particularly promising because long-term memory for music remains relatively preserved in Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias - even in the moderate stage of the disease. Prior studies of music interventions to improve sleep in older adults were conducted with persons without Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias in primarily Caucasian older adults. Thus, the evidence for tailored music interventions to improve sleep in underrepresented community- dwelling persons living with dementia (PLWD) and their caregivers is lacking. In a pilot study (funded by the NIA, F32AG060630) the applicant has examined the feasibility of one component of the proposed music-based intervention in PLWD and their caregivers and identified opportunities to improve the delivery of the intervention. The purpose of this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to provide her with the expertise necessary to initiate a successful and independent program of research - with the ultimate goal to improve sleep and behavioral symptoms in PLWD and their caregivers using music-based approaches. The specific aims of this proposal are to: i) build and iteratively refine the prototype of the mobile application, entitled, ""Calming Music Personalized for Sleep Enhancement in PeRsons living with Dementia"" (CoMPoSER) for use among PLWD and their caregivers; ii) in a pilot RCT examine its acceptability; and iii) efficacy. The development of the intervention will be guided by the input from stakeholders, including PLWD and their caregivers. Seventy-two dyads will be randomized to either the 4-week CoMPoSER intervention or sleep education group. Music selections will be tailored to PLWD and account for known sleep-inducing properties. Acceptability will be examined using survey and qualitative data. The effects of the intervention on PLWD and caregiver outcomes will be determined using objective (actigraphy) and subjective (proxy reported) measures. Under the guidance of the mentoring team, the applicant has carefully constructed research training activities to gain knowledge and expertise in four core areas: i) user-centered design of mobile application technology, ii) behavioral intervention development, iii) Community-based Participatory Research, and iv) behavioral research methods, including measurement, analysis and dissemination of clinical trial research. Results from the proposed research project will not only inform a larger efficacy trial, but also provide an opportunity for the applicant to gain the necessary skills to launch her career as an independent investigator.",K23,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10283569,K23AG073618,K23AG073618-01,73618,,,2021,1,802,Audie,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1552,CBT by Phone to Promote Use of Alcohol Related Care and Reduce Drinking,"Numerous evidence based treatments for alcohol use disorder (AUD) have been developed, and research shows that individuals who obtain alcohol specialty care have improved drinking outcomes and are more likely to recover, yet a small percentage of individuals with AUD obtain treatment. Use of Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) interventions is a potential strategy to increase treatment seeking, yet there is little evidence that these interventions increase participation in alcohol-related care and a lack of evidence that such care serves as a mechanism for improved drinking outcomes. The current randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a one session intervention delivered by telephone seeks to address these gaps in evidence. The specific aims are to show that research volunteers ages 18 and older with AUD who are assigned to the intervention compared to an information control condition are more likely to initiate alcohol specialty care (aim 1), have decreased frequency of alcohol use (as measured by percent days abstinent) and intensity of alcohol use (as measured by drinks per drinking day) (aim 2), and that treatment engagement serves as a mediator of the improved drinking outcomes (aim 3). Innovations include the use of an SBIRT intervention based on the theory of planned behavior and cognitive behavioral treatment principles and that the intervention was developed for phone administration from the onset and was explicitly designed to promote treatment engagement. The project is in response to PA-15-299, Alcohol Use Disorders: Behavioral Treatment, Services, and Recovery Research. It builds on a smaller efficacy trial that showed that the intervention leads to increased engagement in alcohol-related care (Stecker et al., 2012) and extends that study in several ways including through the use of a priori tests to determine efficacy of the intervention to improve drinking outcomes and that treatment engagement serves as a mediator of the improved outcomes.",R01,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9574417,R01AA026815,R01AA026815-01,26815,,,2018,1,805,Pablo,,,,,,,,,
1554,Illuminating brain function during imitation in children with ASD with DOT,"The long-term goal of these studies is to advance high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) methods for evaluating brain-behavior relationships in school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and toddlers at risk for developing ASD while they imitate novel gross motor movements within a naturalistic setting. We are submitting this application in response to FOA: PA-21-200, Research on Autism Spectrum Disorders. In typical development, imitation is associated with the emergence of several behaviors crucial to normal social interaction and communication, including joint attention, play initiation, social affiliation, and prosocial behaviors. Indeed, patterns of impaired imitation, and visual-motor integration (VMI) more generally, have been observed across a wide range of children with ASD, with imitation ability being associated with social-communicative skills in ASD. A challenge in developing imitation as a phenotypic biomarker is the lack of understanding of the neural mechanisms contributing to imitation deficits in ASD, and the variable results in the neuroimaging literature. The mixed findings may be due to the significant limitations in assessing motor imitation in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning environment where there are severe restrictions on motion. This disconnect between consistent behavioral differences in children with ASD and the variable neuroimaging literature motivated the current proposal to use instead HD-DOT during motor imitation. HD-DOT provides a compelling alternative that overcomes the significant ergonomic limitations of fMRI and silently images brain function with a wearable cap in a naturalistic setting ideal for studies on gross motor movement and imitation in both school- aged children and toddlers. The proposed program of research is highly innovative, transformative, and has the potential to elucidate underlying mechanisms, inform clinical interventions, and improve outcome of ASD. As such, this research is harmonious with the mission of NIMH: to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. Early behavioral and educational interventions, starting at 18-48 months of age, improve outcomes in a subset of patients. Neuroimaging methods have demonstrated sensitivity to neural signatures of ASD that may inform diagnosis and track responses to interventions. Here we propose to forge new paths with a dual-armed study of brain function directly underlying motor movement in school- and pre-school-aged children with ASD. Specifically, we will measure neural signatures while participants perform naturalistic motor imitation and movement observation. These data may provide markers to the specific aspects of impaired behavior observed in ASD, namely affected social communication, receptive and expressive language, motor coordination disruption, and even restricted and repetitive behaviors. Further, this strategy provides a diversified approach to assessment that will be applicable across development, and may facilitate identification of common mechanisms by which disparate genetic pathways to autism result in the broad autistic phenotype.",R21,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10452280,R21MH127501,R21MH127501-01A1,127501,A1,,2022,1,806,Tom,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1574,Emergency General Surgery Delirium Recovery Model: A Collaborative Care Intervention,"Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by acute and fluctuating changes in cognition and consciousness. Delirium survivors suffer from a cluster of cognitive, physical, and psychological disabilities. These disabilities lead to high healthcare utilization, lower quality of life, and loss of functional independence. Worse, a single episode of delirium increases the risk of Alzheimer disease and related dementias. Based on work from our group and the work of others, over 25% of patients who undergo emergency intra-abdominal surgery suffer from at least one episode of delirium during the index hospitalization, putting them at high risk for cognitive decline. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge regarding the best way to prevent cognitive, psychological and functional decline in patients who undergo emergency general surgery and subsequently develop delirium. The long-term goal of this line of research is to improve the health and quality of care for older emergency general surgery survivors. The objective of this application is to apply the concepts of collaborative care to a high-risk patient population. Indiana University School of Medicine and University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health researchers have over 20 years of experience developing innovative and effective collaborative care models that integrate with primary care and specialty physicians to address the complex biopsychosocial needs of patients with chronic disease states, such as dementia and depression. Our team has developed a specific collaborative care model called the Emergency General Surgery Delirium Recovery Program. This proposal aims to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of 12-months of collaborative care in improving the cognitive, functional and psychological recovery of emergency intra-abdominal surgery patients who suffer at least one episode of delirium in the post-operative period and are at least 65 years old. The trial has the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the ability of the Emergency General Surgery Delirium Recovery Model to improve the cognitive recovery of older Emergency General Surgery delirium survivors; and 2) Evaluate the ability of the Emergency General Surgery Delirium Recovery Model to improve the physical recovery of older Emergency General Surgery delirium survivors; and 3) Evaluate the ability of the Emergency General Surgery Delirium Recovery Model to improve the psychological recovery of older Emergency General Surgery delirium survivors. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo. Previous collaborative care models focused on chronic care management and they lack rapid adaptability. We have also adapted the intervention to be completed solely via telehealth. This contribution will be significant as broad application of the Emergency General Surgery Delirium Recovery Program at hospitals across the country could result in better health and improved quality of care for a particularly vulnerable patient population.",R01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10416631,R01AG076489,R01AG076489-01,76489,,,2022,1,818,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1617,"Slow wave sleep (SWS) and the effect of African ancestry on amyloid burden, a longitudinal study","African-Americans (AAs) have an increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to whites, which traditionally has been associated to the presence of vascular disease. However, a recent community- based study of non-demented elderly, as well as our preliminary data, suggest that AAs have higher amyloid burden after adjusting for vascular risk factors, which points to the presence of additional genetic or physiological differences on AD-risk by race. The purpose of this study is to test whether poor slow wave sleep (SWS) is one of these factors. Sleep disturbances vary between AAs and non-Hispanic whites. AAs take longer to fall asleep, have shorter sleep duration, lower sleep efficiency and, more characteristically, less SWS duration when compared to whites. Relatedly, amyloid positive healthy elderly, as well as those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, experience more sleep fragmentation and more decreased SWS and REM sleep duration than their healthy counterparts. This suggests: i) that disturbed sleep contributes to AD- neurodegeneration (or that sleep is particularly sensitive to amyloid deposition); and, ii) that race-related sleep differences might contribute to the reported increases in amyloid burden in AAs. The study has two goals: first, to confirm that black race is associated in vivo with longitudinal increases in amyloid-PET uptake and cognitive decline; second, to demostrate that poor SWS at baseline is associated with these increases after controling for the cardiovascular morbidity that is shared between sleep disturbances and dementia and might confound these associations. In consultation with community stakeholders, we will recruit 150 cognitively normal AA elderly (ages 55-75 years) and 60 whites balanced by age, sex, BMI, education and other socio- demographic variables and from the same Brooklyn neighborhoods. Visit one will include a full clinical evaluation, neuropsychological tests and clinical labs. Participants will later undergo home monitoring for OSA for two nights followed by 5 days of actigraphy. Subjects with normal sleep breathing will be invited to perform 2 nights of nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) followed by a second final visit in which amyloid load and cerebrovascular morbidity will be analyzed by 11C-PiB PET-MR. All subjects will be invited to repeat both visits after 30 months. This study has the potential to identify clinical predictors of amyloid burden in cognitively normal AA elderly and would be an important step towards the prevention of dementia in the black community as well as the reduction of health inequities.",R01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9523017,R01AG056531,R01AG056531-01A1,56531,A1,,2018,1,809,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1642,A Prescription Digital Therapeutic to Promote Adherence to Buprenorphine Pharmacotherapy for Patients with Opioid Use Disorder,"Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a key driver of the current opioid epidemic in the United States. Nearly 80% of individuals with OUD do not receive treatment. Buprenorphine Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) is an effective form of care for OUD. Buprenorphine ameliorates craving and withdrawal, and reduces illicit opioid use, mortality, and problems associated with drug use. However, adoption of buprenorphine in clinical practice is not yet commensurate with patient need. In addition, poor induction experiences and medication nonadherence are associated with high likelihood of treatment drop out and relapse. The perceived need for observed buprenorphine induction contributes to providers' unwillingness to prescribe buprenorphine to patients, thereby limiting patients' access to standard of care. Maximizing the efficacy and accessibility of existing pharmacotherapeutics is critical to helping individuals with OUD receive optimal and necessary care. Thus, an urgent need exists to improve medication adherence and provide strategies to alleviate potential barriers to implementation of buprenorphine in clinical practice (e.g. induction support). The premise of this proposal is to develop a state of the art, digital therapeutic that 1) effectively promotes buprenorphine adherence by providing contingency management rewards and educational content to reinforce the importance of medication in recovery and 2) effectively assists home induction with a new self-monitoring support tool designed for patients. This solution, named reSET-O+, will be integrated with Pear Therapeutics' reSET-O, an FDA market-authorized mobile application delivering validated behavioral therapy and intended for use in conjunction with buprenorphine and standard outpatient treatment for OUD. Phase I of this proposal will focus on developing and testing a functional reSET-O+ prototype to establish feasibility (e.g. acceptability) in patients with OUD. Phase II efforts will expand, refine and validate the reSET-O+ intervention. Phase IIa will use iterative patient feedback to expand the medication adherence-based contingency management system and refine buprenorphine-related content and features. A small randomized controlled trial comparing reSET-O+ to reSET-O will evaluate efficacy (e.g. induction success and medication adherence), safety, and patient engagement in Phase IIb. reSET-O+ will provide an innovative approach for OUD treatment that addresses shortcomings in the current standard of care such as buprenorphine uptake and adherence. A widely accessible digital therapeutic which effectively supports induction and adherence to buprenorphine, and is integrated within a validated behavioral therapy, is likely to promote recovery by facilitating treatment retention, relapse prevention, and better clinical outcomes. Given the number of individuals in need of MAT and the impact medication nonadherence has on patient outcomes, there is a substantial need for reSET-O+.",R44,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9839289,R44DA049493,R44DA049493-01,49493,,,2019,1,854,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1650,"Quantification of patterns of multimorbidity to develop effective and efficient models of HIV, TB and NCD co-care in rural South Africa","As HIV prevention and treatment efforts are successfully scaling up, life expectancies of individuals living with HIV are approaching to that in the general population. In rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where adult HIV prevalence exceeds 20%, a growing proportion of individuals living with HIV are aged over 50 years, putting them at the risk of developing age-associated co-morbidities. To ensure effective screening, diagnosis, and treatment efforts for HIV, TB and associated non-communicable diseases (NCDs), a comprehensive understanding of the disease drivers and distribution, as well as the interactive mechanisms of the co- epidemics among people living with HIV will be critical in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Our overarching goal in this project is to quantify the overlap in the infectious (HIV and TB) and non- communicable disease (hypertension, diabetes and obesity) epidemics and to determine their key individual, familial, household, and geospatial risk factors to ultimately design an effective and efficient care delivery model relevant to the overlapping epidemics in SSA. The project will take advantage of one of the largest ongoing population-based HIV cohorts in the world - the Africa Health Research Institute's population cohort. Vukuzazi (""Wake up and know ourselves"" in isiZulu), a multi-omics population science platform was established in 2018 to add comprehensive health phenotyping for multiple diseases, including HIV, TB, and diabetes, hypertension and diabetes to the ongoing longitudinal population surveillance platform. In light of the syndemic theory framework, the project will leverage the fully integrated data from both research platforms and utilize multilevel and spatial-temporal modelling to understand the interactive mechanisms and spatial distribution of the co-epidemics. The epidemiological and spatial understanding of the co-epidemics will also provide an opportunity to inform development of a co-care delivery model for integration of NCD care into HIV/TB co-delivery models in a HIV hyperendemic rural African setting. Building on one of the world's largest ongoing population-based cohorts, the project will bring together a team of investigators with diverse and complementary areas of expertise to establish a multilevel analytical, methodological, and theoretical framework to address the emerging multimorbidity epidemic in South Africa and other similar settings in SSA. This framework will be co-developed by US, UK and South African investigators and trainees and will significantly enhance local capacity. Results from this study will be among the first to disentangle the complex associations between the individual, familial, household and community factors that impact HIV, TB and NCD risk in one of the world's most severely affected populations.

1667,Acitivity for Diabetic Polyneuropathy: The ADAPT Study,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects >8% of Americans, half of whom develop diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). DPN is a major cause for disability due to sensory loss, pain, gait instability, falls, foot ulcers and amputations. There are no effective disease altering therapies for DPN in T2D. Even intensive glycemic control, which is of proven benefit in T1D, is only marginally effective in reducing DPN risk in T2D. The Utah Diabetic Neuropathy Study (UDNS) aimed to facilitate therapeutic development for DPN by evaluating skin biopsy with assessment of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) as a biomarker. Results indicate that early DPN is characterized by progressive loss of small fiber function, reflected in declining IENFD, cold thermal sensation and sudomotor function. IENFD correlates with patient symptoms, notably pain severity, and physical examination scores. Early IENFD decline predicts future risk of incident DPN. Among 84 T2D participants randomized to intensive exercise or general counseling, the former experienced a significant improvement in IENFD compared to no change in the control group. These results add to other preliminary data indicating that successful exercise results in improvement in peripheral nerve regenerative capacity. Unfortunately, intensive exercise is of limited long-term efficacy due to poor compliance and the behavioral pattern of compensatory increase in caloric intact and sedentary behavior. We hypothesize that an intervention integrating moderate supervised exercise with actigraphy based strategies to reduce sedentary behavior will result in sustainable metabolic improvement and that this novel strategy will slow the rate of IENFD decline and improve neuropathy specific quality of life in patients with DPN due to T2D. We hypothesize the intervention will improve insulin sensitivity and reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, resulting in enhanced peripheral nerve regenerative capacity. The Activity for Diabetic Polyneuropathy - ADAPT Study will randomize 140 T2D patients with mild to moderate DPN to either generic annual counseling or an integrated program of moderate supervised exercise and actigraphy based anti-sedentariness counseling. IENFD at the distal thigh and the Norfolk Quality of Life - Diabetic Neuropathy (NQOL-DN) will serve as primary endpoint measures. The study will be judged positive if there is a treatment response in both endpoints. The goal is to determine if this novel approach to increasing home activity and reduced sedentary time is an effective therapy for DPN. A second objective is to better evaluate the clinical meaning of change in IENFD. Skin biopsies will be used to explore the intervention's impact on epidermal regeneration and inflammation. Skin, serum and DNA will be banked for future mechanistic studies. There is an urgent need for better early DPN biomarkers. Our data indicate IENFD is reproducible and responsive, and that it correlates with clinically meaningful features of DPN in a cross sectional fashion, but the patient focused meaning of its decline is unknown. The results of the ADAPT Study will be of immediate significance. If the intervention were successful, a greater clinical focus on strategies to reduced sedentary behavior at home would be justifiable and a randomized trial to demonstrate effectiveness in a clinical setting would be appropriate. Demonstration of a minimally clinically meaningful change in IENFD would greatly facilitate early phase proof of concept trials for DPN, thus supporting therapeutic development for this common and disabling diabetic complication.",R01,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,8886258,R01DK064814,R01DK064814-09A1,64814,A1,,2015,9,834,,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1674,Improving retention in care for persons with HIV who use substances by increasing acceptance and reducing stigma,"As many as 50% of people with HIV (PWH) are not in regular HIV primary care in the U.S. This is particularly common for PWH who use substances such as cocaine, methamphetamines, and opioids. PWH who are not consistently retained in care are at risk for: delayed antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation, reduced ART adherence, unsuppressed viremia, and mortality. Moreover, poor retention means effective ART cannot be leveraged to prevent further HIV transmission. The long-term goal is to develop impactful, brief intervention techniques that can be easily integrated into usual care practices to enhance HIV care retention. The objective of this proposal, which is the next step in attaining the long-term goal, is to adapt and refine an existing retention intervention in the context of an open trial and a small randomized controlled trial. We will adapt a brief, 2-session acceptance-based behavioral therapy (ABBT) intervention to enhance retention in HIV care for people who use substances by targeting stigma. ABBT promotes an accepting stance towards life's challenges and encourages participants to thoughtfully disclose the serostatus and/or substance abuse problems as a behavioral step towards challenging stigmatization fears. The central hypothesis is that increased tolerance of stigmatization, facilitated through increased acceptance of HIV status and substance abuse behaviors, will increase PWH's longitudinal commitment to care. The aims of this proposal are: (1) To use an iterative process to refine ABBT for substance using, out-of- care PWH by conducting an open trial in English-speakers (n=7) and monolingual Spanish speakers (n=3); and, (2) To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (n = 50; incl. 10 Spanish speakers) of ABBT vs. Treatment-as-Usual (TAU). Primary outcome will be retention in care. The sample will consist of 60 HIV patients who have not attended a medical visit in at least 9 months at our infectious diseases clinic in Providence, R.I. The approach is innovative in that it departs from the status quo by using brief acceptance- based psychotherapy techniques, delivered by telehealth, to increase acceptance of HIV status and substance abuse problems and promoting careful and thoughtful disclosure as a specific mechanism to support retention. Additionally, ABBT will be adapted for monolingual Spanish speakers as this cohort of PWH needs more research attention.

1685,Peer Coaching for Physical Activity Promotion among Breast Cancer Survivors: Adapting an Efficacious Intervention to Prepare for Implementation,"Interventions promoting physical activity among cancer survivors improve their functioning, reduce fatigue and offer other benefits in cancer recovery and risk reduction for future cancer. There is a need for interventions that can be implemented on a wider-scale than in research settings. Our 12-week theory-based exercise intervention that was delivered by research staff by telephone was efficacious in improving fitness, and increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among breast, colorectal and endometrial cancer survivors. To widen the intervention's reach, we trained peer coaches in the American Cancer Society's Reach to Recovery program to deliver the same MVPA intervention called Moving Forward Together (MFT) to other breast cancer survivors. In a randomized controlled trial, MFT significantly increased MVPA and provided psychosocial benefits for these survivors (Pinto, Stein & Dunsiger, 2015). Now, our goal is to prepare for wider implementation of MFT by automating key resource-intensive components such as matching survivors with a coach by using a web-based peer mentoring platform and to collect key indices to prepare for large scale implementation. InquistHealth's web platform (Mentor1to1™) has demonstrated to be effective in peer mentoring for chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes). We will partner with InquisitHealth to adapt their web platform for MFT. The aim is to streamline intervention delivery, assure fidelity and improve survivor outcomes. There will be two phases in this 4-year R01 application: in Phase 1, we will work with 6 peer coaches who have already delivered MFT (our original evidence-based MVPA intervention) in prior work. Using iterative user-centered design principles, we will modify the web platform for MFT, creating webMFT. In Phase 2, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial in which 10-12 peer coaches will deliver webMFT to 56 breast cancer survivors who will be randomized to receive either webMFT or MVPA Tracking. We will recruit and train coaches naïve to MFT from three cancer care organizations with peer mentoring programs. We will collect feasibility and acceptability data about webMFT from the coaches. We will examine survivor outcomes (objectively measured MVPA and self-reported fatigue, quality of life, physical functioning and mood) by using mixed effects regression models to compare groups at 12 weeks. We will obtain survivors' feedback on their experience with webMFT. Based on the RE-AIM framework and PRISM, we will collect data on implementation indices at the organizational level by conducting key multi-level stakeholder interviews. Using newer technologies for enhanced intervention delivery, program management and automated data collection has the exciting promise of facilitating effective implementation by organizations with limited resources. Adapting evidence-based MFT to a customized web platform and collecting data at multiple-levels (coaches, survivors and organizations) along with costs will provide a strong foundation for a robust multi-site implementation trial to increase MVPA (and its benefits) among many more breast cancer survivors.",R01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10046433,R01CA242745,R01CA242745-01A1,242745,A1,,2021,1,843,,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
1686,"1/5, HEAL Consortium: Establishing Innovative Approaches for the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study","Opioid use among pregnant women is increasing significantly, and consequently, a more than 5-fold increase in the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has been reported since 2000. Preliminary studies show that prenatal opioid exposure is associated with increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment across cognitive, motor and behavioral domains. Therefore, studies to rigorously characterize the impacts of prenatal opioid exposure on early brain development are critically needed. In our application, five institutions (Duke University, Arkansas Children's Research Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) with complementary expertise, have formed a consortium to develop strategies to prepare for the Phase II HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study, a planned large scale multi-site research study to examine the long-term impact of prenatal drug exposure on long term childhood outcomes. Leveraging the unique skills of our multidisciplinary team, we will develop essential instruments and strategies (recruitment/retention protocols, assessment batteries, and novel tools) for the Phase II study (Aim 1). We will conduct pilot studies (fetal and postnatal imaging, advanced imaging harmonization and quality control, assessment administration, biosampling) to evaluate instruments for the Phase II study (Aim 2). Finally, we will analyze available data (Aim 3), including imaging, behavioral, cognitive and maternal data from studies focusing on early brain development, to provide critical information to guide the Phase II study design.

1687,The Impact of Insomnia Treatment on Heavy Alcohol Use among Returning Veterans,"Heavy alcohol use is prevalent among returning Veterans and results in significant physical and psychological burden. One in five returning Veterans screens positive for probable past-year alcohol use disorder (AUD), and few hold positive beliefs about mental health treatment. Moreover, brief interventions for alcohol use demonstrate limited efficacy within this population. Thus, additional strategies are needed to engage and treat returning Veterans who may be at risk for AUD. More than half of returning Veterans who screen positive for hazardous drinking report clinically significant symptoms of insomnia. In turn, insomnia symptoms have been associated with increased risk of alcohol-related problems, perhaps due to insomnia-related impairments in executive functioning, negative emotionality, craving for alcohol, and use of alcohol as a sleep aid. The proposed K23 aims to determine the utility of the first line of treatment for insomnia (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia or CBT-I) in reducing alcohol use and related problems among returning Veterans. Forty- four returning Veterans who indicate risk for problem drinking on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C scores ≥4/5 for women/men) and have insomnia based on DSM-5 and research diagnostic criteria will participate in a randomized pilot trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive personalized normative alcohol feedback in the context of one of two treatment conditions: CBT-I (n = 22) or a time- matched Behavioral Placebo Treatment (BPT; n = 22). Outcomes will be assessed at the end of the active intervention period (6 weeks), mid-treatment (after 3 sessions), and at 3 months post-intervention. Outcomes of interest include insomnia severity, total wake time, sleep quality, drinking quantity/frequency, alcohol-related consequences, executive functioning, negative affect, emotion regulation, craving for alcohol, and use of alcohol as a sleep aid. This research will provide Dr. Miller with mentored training in (1) the methodology of multi-session insomnia treatment research, including daily assessment and mechanistic behavioral trial design; (2) the interplay of sleep and alcohol use disorders; (3) assessment of executive functioning; and (4) longitudinal mixed effects modeling. Training will take place under the mentorship of an impressive team with complimentary areas of expertise. The proposed 5-year career development plan will facilitate Dr. Miller's transition to independent research by providing her the skills to (a) compete successfully for federal funding to conduct high-quality research, (b) advance our understanding of the etiology of AUD, and (c) contribute uniquely to alcohol addiction prevention and treatment research. The proposed research aims to reduce the harms associated with heavy alcohol use among Veterans by improving the availability of efficacious treatment. It will impact our understanding of the benefits of CBT-I, and it is innovative because it evaluates improvement in insomnia as a mechanism for improvements in AUD. This research is consistent with NIAAA's initiative to evaluate and promote interventions that prevent the progression of AUD in diverse populations.",K23,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9742251,K23AA026895,K23AA026895-01A1,26895,A1,,2019,1,844,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1706,A Translational Randomized Clinical Trial of Varenicline Sampling to Promote Smoking Cessation and Scalable Treatment Dissemination,"Smoking is the leading risk factor for preventable morbidity and mortality, and smoking cessation remains the primary goal for population-based tobacco and cancer control. Many smokers lack resources to initiate and sustain a successful quit attempt. For the last decade we have been testing innovative approaches for delivery of pharmacotherapies that allow smokers to try evidence-based cessation medications and self- determine their goals and pace for cessation. Medication sampling is a brief, concrete, and easily understood exercise that often induces attitudinal shifts in favor of quitting smoking, and more importantly promotes quit attempts and actual cessation. Medication sampling is also favored by healthcare providers, augmenting their brief advice as per clinical guidelines. We have conducted three trials of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) sampling (N=157, 849, 1245), all of which were remote, and some of which have been applied within medical settings. Each trial demonstrated increases in cessation behavior. Our prior work on NRT sampling creates a compelling question as to whether varenicline sampling would have similar, or potentially better, effects. Varenicline is inarguably the most effective single cessation medication available, superior to other monotherapy options. As a prescription medication, whether varenicline is suitable for sampling is unclear but worth testing empirically. On one hand, unstructured use, over a brief time, may not deliver sufficient pharmacologic benefit. Prescription delivery incurs its own barriers to widespread dissemination (which can be overcome). On the other hand, much like NRT sampling, it could provide a tangible cue to action that provides psychological engagement (motivation, confidence, autonomy) to sustain subsequent use and ultimately enhance cessation. A trial of varenicline sampling is not merely a routine extension of NRT trials, yet the significance is even more compelling given evidence of its unique benefits. We therefore propose a randomized clinical trial with primary aims to determine the 1) use, 2) consequences (on cessation), and 3) mechanisms of varenicline sampling. A demographically diverse sample of 648 smokers will be recruited across South Carolina and randomized (2:1:1) to receive I) a 4-week sample of varenicline, II) a 4-week supply of NRT, or III) nothing. Thus, our design is strengthened by both active and inactive comparison groups. Outcomes will be assessed through 6 months of follow-up. We employ innovations in mobile health technologies throughout to enhance methodological rigor, including remote biological verification of smoking behavior. If varenicline sampling were to show promise through this and future trials, this would offer great dissemination appeal to physicians, quitlines, etc in that, much like our NRT work, varenicline sampling could be a pragmatic strategy to engage more smokers in better treatments, sooner. Ultimately, the population impact of medication/varenicline sampling could be profound, offering a significant and measurable opportunity to lessen the impact of tobacco on public health and to reduce the risk, incidence and mortality of cancer.",R01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10049313,R01CA246729,R01CA246729-01A1,246729,A1,,2020,1,886,Tom,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1715,Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,"Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques.",R01,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9524533,R01DK114945,R01DK114945-01A1,114945,A1,,2018,1,858,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1725,A sleep electroencephalography biomarker predicting Alzheimer's disease pathology,"Early biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease are urgently required for at least three reasons: (i) to determine which individuals are at greatest Alzheimer's disease risk, thereby (ii) offering preventative intervention, pre-disease onset, and (iii) further allowing nascent treatment intervention as early as possible in the disease process. All three goals demand a sensitive, non-invasive, affordable, accessible biomarker of Alzheimer's disease pathology/progression. Addressing these needs, we propose to test the hypothesis that a unique NREM sleep EEG signature provides a candidate early biomarker of Aβ pathology, one that may accurately track and forecast Alzheimer's disease risk and Alzheimer's disease pathophysiological progression. If correct, the proposal would establish a novel, inexpensive, and early diagnostic tool for determining Alzheimer's disease risk and pathology progression before clinical symptoms emerge, and one that is suitable for community settings. Moreover, such data would motivate an increased medical awareness regarding the importance of treating sleep difficulties across the lifespan, and further motivate the development (clinical or commercial) of sleep-based interventions that improve adult sleep and thus reduce Alzheimer's disease prevalence and its societal burden. More generally, such findings would argue for improved public health policies advocating for sufficient quality sleep throughout adulthood-a memorandum that may lower dementia risk and maintain cognitive health across the populous.",RF1,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9194204,RF1AG054019,RF1AG054019-01,54019,,,2016,1,863,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
1745,"Promoting small business support of youth physical activity in low-income, minority neighborhoods","An unacceptably high percentage of our nation's low-income, minority youth (< 18 years of age) are not regularly physically active. This contributes to extreme health disparities such as obesity rates nearly two-fold higher than those seen in white youth and greater risk for diabetes and related cardiometabolic disorders. The presence of quality youth physical activity opportunities (YPAO) enables and encourages physically active lifestyles. Unfortunately, quality YPAOs often are lacking in places where minority youth live, resulting in low activity levels and subsequent health issues that represent significant disparities in our society. Our previous research found that small businesses (< 500 employees), which represent over 99% of all employers, are powerful resources for creating and improving YPAOs. In accordance with the Socioecological Model and established philanthropic principles, we developed an alpha version of an intervention (alpha-i) for increasing small businesses' involvement with YPAOs. We are now poised to create a beta version (beta-i) and conduct a pilot study of its impact on small business support for YPAOs and YPAO utilization by youth in low-income, minority neighborhoods. To meet this objective, we will complete the following specific aims. Aim 1: Refine alpha-i components by completing focus groups with small business owners, YPAO providers, and parents/guardians of youth from low-income, predominantly minority neighborhoods. Results of the qualitative analysis will inform final tailoring of the intervention to create the beta-i which will be tested in Aim 2. Aim 2: Determine the effect of the beta-i on small business support for YPAOs in low-income, minority neighborhoods by conducting a plot cluster randomized-control trial with randomization at the neighborhood level. Intervention neighborhoods (n=10) will receive the beta-i while control neighborhoods (n=10) will be provided a standard practice intervention for a period of one year. The primary outcome for aim 2 will be the percentage of small businesses not supporting YPAOs at baseline that subsequently provide support for YPAOs at follow-up. We also will consider the U.S. dollar equivalent of all types of support (monetary, goods/services and time) donated for YPAOs by small businesses. Aim 3: Examine the impact of the increased small business support for YPAOs on YPAO utilization by youth. The primary outcome will be the percent change in the number of youth participating in YPAOs from baseline and follow-up in the treatment and control neighborhoods. The proposed study is significant because it will provide evidence that an easily replicated approach can be used to increase small business support for YPAOs and that this support results in greater use of the YPAOs by youth. Our next step will be to determine if YPAO changes resulting from increased small business support positively influence youth physical activity levels as measured by accelerometry. Our long-term goals are to create a nationally implementable practice for increasing support for YPAOs and strengthen the science of addressing health disparities in socially disadvantaged populations.",R21,NR,NINR,NR;OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9528906,R21NR017267,R21NR017267-01A1,17267,A1,,2018,1,873,,,,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
1747,Novel Methods to Identify Momentary Risk States for Stress & Physical Inactivity,"Novel Methods to Identify Momentary Risk States for Stress & Physical Inactivity Behavioral risk factors, such as physical inactivity, poor stress management, poor diet, and smoking, are responsible for about 80% of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease (WHO, 2011), and they are partly responsible for other negative health outcomes, such as high lipids, high blood pressure, cancer, diabetes, and obesity. Thus, helping individuals to change unhealthy behaviors and maintain healthy ones can decrease morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. It can also help individuals manage symptoms of osteoarthritis, menopause, and other physical issues that impact health and quality of life. This BD2K K01 proposal is for the purpose of establishing myself as an independent researcher in the development and application of big data methods for health-behavior change and maintenance. I aspire to improve public health by developing, extending, and applying big data methods in biobehavioral health research to help individuals develop and maintain positive health behaviors, specifically those related to physical activity, diet, and stress management. To achieve this goal, my training plan focuses on developing expertise in (a) statistical methods for the analysis of large, complex, high-dimensional data; (b) computer science and informatics, along with advanced high-performance computing topics for accessing, managing, and processing big data; and (c) the theories and measurement of health behavior change, specifically with regards to intensive assessment of physical activity and stress management. My training and research activities will take place under the mentorship of Drs. Runze Li (primary mentor), Vasant Honavar (co-mentor), and Joshua Smyth (co-mentor). In order to examine individuals' engagement in physical activity, stress management, and other health behaviors, I will use this funding to develop and apply big data methods that can integrate data across multiple time scales and studies, better infer causality, and account for dependencies (e.g., time-structure, dyads) in the data. I will publish manuscripts on these methods in both technical and health-behavior journals, and I will disseminate software to clinical researchers so that they can use these methods in their work. At the completion of this grant, I will be prepared to make important contributions as the data scientist on interdisciplinar teams that develop health behavior interventions.

1760,Improving HIV Care with mHealth Tools: An App to Detect Neurocognitive Impairment,"Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) is one of the most common clinical conditions seen in HIV, affecting as many as 70% of infected individuals, including those on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and with well-controlled viremia. The NCI seen in HIV has significant medical, functional, and public health consequences (e.g., problems adhering to ART), but often goes undetected in the clinical setting. Routine screening for HIV-related NCI can enhance provider-patient communication to help patients with NCI better manage their ART adherence and other health outcomes, but doing so faces challenges. For instance, most screening tools for NCI in HIV clinics are paper-and-pencil tests prone to administration and scoring errors that require highly trained personnel to administer, score and interpret, require additional equipment, and are not well-suited for modern clinics utilizing electronic medical records. To address this public health and medical practice gap, we have developed an mHealth tool to make screening more accessible and sustainable in the modern clinical setting. NeuroScreen is a brief, easy-to-use NCI screening test application (app) for Android mobile devices designed to be administered by a wide range of non-expert healthcare personnel. The app is highly automated (e.g., does not require any record keeping or scoring) with standardized instructions ensuring consistent administrations each and every time with minimal training. NeuroScreen is ultra-portable (i.e., usable in any clinic exam room, remote and rural settings, or during home visits) and totally self-contained (i.e., no need for paper forms, pens, stopwatches, or other apparatuses). Results from NeuroScreen are available immediately and can be transmitted electronically to a variety of end-users, such as primary care providers, HIV specialists and/or electronic medical records, as well as to databases for population level monitoring. This study will assess the usability and acceptability of a tablet-based NeuroScreen by HIV care providers of differing expertise levels (e.g., physicians, nurses, and case managers), and identify provider- and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to integrating this mHealth tool into clinical practice. The study will then evaluate NeuroScreen's accuracy to detect mild NCI in 182 HIV-infected adults with NCI (n=91) and without NCI (n=91). With an easy-to-use and accurate tool to detect NCI and well-suited for clinics using and moving towards electronic medical systems, early detection and on-going monitoring of impairment could be realized and help healthcare providers communicate more effectively with patients about their treatment and care, make better referrals, and offer tailored ART adherence interventions and strategies as well as HIV prevention services. Furthermore, NeuroScreen offers health systems a viable method to collect large quantities of neurocognitive data suited to population level epidemiological research and other studies utilizing big data. An mHealth tool, like NeuroScreen, could be easily modified for use in other disease populations and regions of the world that rely on task-shifting due to very limited healthcare resources.",R21,NR,NINR,NR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8845353,R21NR015009,R21NR015009-01A1,15009,A1,,2015,1,913,Tom,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
1773,Sleep Physiology and Risk for Alcohol Problems in Children of Alcoholics,"This proposed project is a resubmission of the PI's first R01 application. Alcohol-dependent individuals have well-described disturbances of sleep, but whether these sleep disturbances precede or follow heavy, problem drinking is unknown. Several lines of evidence across the human life span now suggest that sleep disturbances may precede and represent a marker of risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. For instance, there appears to be a longitudinal relationship between sleep problems, alcohol use, and alcohol use disorders in both adolescents and adults. Very few studies, however, have systematically examined the sleep patterns, habits, and architecture of biological children of an alcohol- dependent parent (COAs), who already are at increased risk both to drink earlier than their peers and to have an early onset of alcohol use disorders. A longitudinal investigation of sleep parameters in relation to risk for early onset of alcohol use and alcohol related problems among COAs and controls (non-COAs) would clarify the influence of sleep disturbances and potentially inform prevention and early intervention efforts. The current proposal seeks funding to support a longitudinal study on sleep patterns, architecture, and regulation in COAs and controls. Specific aims are: (i) to examine the sleep patterns, habits, and architecture of COAs and controls over time via multiple measures of sleep, including self-report, parental ratings, actigraphy, and polysomnography; (ii) to understand the effects of sleep disturbances on neurocognitive functions, behavioral problems, and risk for early alcohol use/abuse among COAs and controls; and (iii) to understand how gender, pubertal development, and perceived stress may moderate the relationship between sleep problems and alcohol use/abuse among COAs and controls. A three-wave longitudinal design is proposed. Participants will be 8-12 years old at Time 1, 9-13 years old at Time 2, and 10-14 years old at Time 3. Multiple measures of sleep, including actigraphy and polysomnography data will be collected at Time 1. At Times 2 and 3, actigraphy will be repeated and data on self-report and parental ratings of sleep, as well as neurocognitive functions and behavioral problems will be gathered. Information regarding onset of alcohol and other drug use, as well as related problems will also be collected at Times 2 and 3. This project has the potential to document the relationships among sleep problems, family history of alcoholism, neurocognitive functions, behavioral problems, and the development of alcohol problems among COAs and controls.

1774,Two-way Texting (2wT) to Improve Patient Retention While Reducing the Healthcare Workload in High-Burden Public HIV Clinics in Malawi,"In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), retention of HIV-infection people in antiretroviral therapy (ART) is an increasing challenge. With only 67% retained on ART in SSA, over 7.5 million people are out of care, threatening both individual health and HIV epidemic control. With significant healthcare system constraints and formidable healthcare worker (HCW) shortages, ART services in SSA struggle to meet ambitious global targets of 90% retained in care. In research settings, text-based mHealth innovations show promise to increase ART retention and, therefore, reduce viral load (VL). However, few mHealth innovations have been tested or proven effective in real-world settings with severe human and financial resource constraints. mHealth innovations that successfully retain more patients on ART, at lower cost, within large-volume public ART clinics in SSA are urgently needed. Lighthouse Trust (LT), the largest public provider of ART in Malawi, operates two large clinics in Lilongwe with the Malawi Ministry of Health (MoH), Lighthouse Clinic (LH) and Martin Preuss Center (MPC), with a combined 35,000 ART patients. 12-month retention at Lighthouse is 67%, below the 90% global target for epidemic control. Both clinics employ a real-time electronic medical records system (EMRS) and implement a resource-intensive patient retention program, Back to Care (B2C). B2C aims to trace patients who miss ART visits by >14 days. MPC has over 7800 monthly ART visits, and more than 10% of clients are B2C-eligible. B2C demand, coupled with HCW constraints, results in tracing of only 33% of target clients. Lack of, or delayed, tracing reduces ART retention. Moreover, over 50% of traced B2C clients are found on ART, 60% of whom had transferred, demonstrating significant unnecessary tracing. Poor data quality reduces B2C effectiveness. Therefore, the University of Washington's International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH) and LT, with support from MoH and Medic Mobile, seek to implement an innovative, proactive, patient retention system using two-way texting (2wT) between new ART patients and staff. 2wT will resolve potential retention issues before they occur and improve data quality (e.g. identifying transfers), reducing B2C workload. Using a quasi-experimental, pre-post design, this R21 (Aim 1) will test a hybrid 2wT intervention to provide adherence support for, and visit-focused communication with, new ART initiates at MPC clinic, comparing retention (ART outcomes, visit adherence, VL) and B2C referrals among two groups of new MPC ART clients: 2wT-supported (prospective intervention) and matched pre-2wT (retrospective comparison). After demonstrating improved retention at lower cost (Aim 2) using research teams (R21: years 1-2), 2wT integration into the EMRS (R33: years 3-5) will automate enrollment and management of 2WT for new clients in both LH and MPC using routine HCWs (Aim 3), assessing the transition of research to practice. The proposed mHealth study will significantly increase ART retention in public ART clinics using routine HCWs, reducing workload and costs.

1784,Development of a Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Reduce High-Intensity Drinking among Young Adults,"High-intensity drinking (HID; 8+/10+ drinks for females/males) is a distinct form of excessive alcohol use that results in significant, even life-threatening, physical and psychological consequences. Fifteen percent of young adults have engaged in HID in the past two weeks, and this form of drinking most often occurs in social settings. Characteristics of the drinking context (e.g. alcohol availability, demographic composition of the event) are associated with levels of alcohol consumption; however, current interventions for young adult alcohol misuse do not address real-time risk factors in the drinking context. The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Cox with the training and mentorship to become an independent behavioral scientist focused on the prevention of young adult alcohol misuse. The objective of the proposed research is to identify risk factors in the immediate drinking context for HID among young adults and use this information to develop and pilot test a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that addresses the identified risk factors to reduce HID and associated consequences. To achieve her long-term career goals, Dr. Cox requires additional training. This K01 will provide the necessary support for Dr. Cox to pursue the following scientific training objectives: (1) obtain skills in the design of mHealth intervention approaches, (2) execute experimental designs to test interventions for young adult alcohol misuse, (3) gain proficiency in priority selection of behavior change techniques for intervention strategies, and (4) enrich statistical capacities in the analysis of intensive longitudinal data. These objectives will be met through a comprehensive training plan that consists of one-on-one meetings, didactics/trainings, mentor-directed readings, seminars/lab meetings, scientific meetings, and hands-on research experience. To support these goals, Dr. Cox has a mentoring team comprised of leading researchers in all of these areas that each have a record of successful NIH-funded research and extensive mentoring experience. Skills gained through the training plan will be put into action through the execution of the complementary research plan. Aim 1 is to determine JITAI decision points by identifying factors in the drinking context that are uniquely associated with HID via a 4-week study using ecological momentary assessment with 50 young adults (ages 18-24). Aim 2 is to iteratively develop a JITAI that addresses identified risk factors to prevent HID among this population. Aim 3 is to pilot test the JITAI to a) assess its feasibility and acceptability, and b) explore preliminary effects on HID. This research is consistent with NIAAA's initiative to develop effective prevention strategies that address the risks for consequences that result from excessive drinking or other forms of alcohol misuse. The proposed study will provide data for Dr. Cox's first R01 proposal, to be submitted in the final year of this proposed award.",K01,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10039203,K01AA028540,K01AA028540-01,28540,,,2020,1,925,Chris,,,,,,,,,
1801,Pre-transplant health coaching to improve patient-reported outcomes in lung transplant candidates,"Self-management abilities reflect patients' capacity to manage emotions, social roles, and chronic medical conditions. In fact, self-management abilities are strongly associated with lung transplant candidates' emotional health. Both self-management abilities and emotional health while waiting for lung transplant predict post- transplant quality of life. Additionally, a candidate's self-management abilities and emotional health pre- transplant are associated with post-transplant adherence to immunosuppressive medications. Given the important role of these pre-transplant factors, the objective of this study is to optimize pre-transplant self- management abilities and emotional health with the long-term objective of improving post-transplant quality of life and transplant outcomes. Health coaching is an effective strategy to improve emotional health and self- management abilities in other populations and in non-transplant candidates with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We used semi-structured, qualitative interviews of lung transplant stakeholders to develop a relevant health coaching intervention for adult lung transplant candidates on the waiting list. In our small, single-center pilot trial we showed telephonic health coaching demonstrated improved pre-transplant self-management abilities, emotional health, and quality of life in comparison to usual care. In this application, we propose a randomized trial of a 30-minute telephonic health-coaching intervention once weekly for 12 weeks (compared to usual care) in 230 lung transplant candidates on the waiting list at the Mayo Clinic in Florida or Minnesota or at UW Medicine in Washington state. Patient-reported outcome instruments measuring emotional health, self- management, and quality of life will be measured at baseline, 12-16 weeks following enrollment, and post- transplant. Our primary outcomes will be differences between groups in Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) domains of Mastery (a measure of self-management) and Emotional function adjusted for baseline values. Secondary outcomes will compare the differences between groups of other psychometric questionnaire scores, adjusted for baseline, as well as short-term post-transplant outcomes. The long-term goal of this application is to optimize post-transplant outcomes through effective pre-transplant interventions. Our central hypothesis is that health coaching will improve lung transplant patients' self-management abilities, emotional health, and quality of life pre-transplant. We further hypothesize that future studies will demonstrate that these pre-transplant improvements in self-management abilities and emotional health will translate into improved post- transplant quality of life. The results of this study will be used to refine the intervention and plan for a larger, multi-center trial designed to optimize dissemination and implementation in diverse settings. This proposal supports the NIH mission by striving to improve outcomes in lung disease patients while supporting a new investigator in her to transition to research independence.",R61,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10449543,R61HL158811,R61HL158811-01A1,158811,A1,,2022,1,901,,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1810,Longitudinal Assessment of Tumor Hypoxia in vivo Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy,"Tumor hypoxia is an important characteristic of solid tumors and a modulator of therapeutic response. Because oxygen diffuses 100-150 m from blood vessels, fast growing tumors often have two hypoxic regions: a chronically hypoxic region in the center of the tumor and a cycling (or acute) hypoxic region within the diffusion distance. Numerous studies have found that hypoxia, especially its temporal fluctuation, leads to enhanced tumor metastasis and resistance to radiation and drugs. Strategies to reduce hypoxia by increasing delivery of oxygen and decreasing oxygen consumption within the tumor are both being explored to overcome hypoxia- induced resistance to radiation and drugs. Therefore, there is growing demand for technologies that noninvasively measure tumor oxygenation temporally in vivo to enable advances in drug screening, development and optimization. However, the relative contributions of chronic hypoxia and cycling hypoxia (CH) as well as the therapeutic responses are difficult to determine primarily due to the lack of a noninvasive tool to continuously quantify the temporal profile of tumor hypoxia in vivo. We have recently developed a side-firing fiber optic sensor and a 1st generation (GEN-1) frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (FD-NIRS) for quantification of tissue oxygenation and total hemoglobin content in model tumors. The flat sensor can be easily and reliably attached to a tumor surface and thus is an ideal tool for longitudinal monitoring of rodent tumor models and studying anti-hypoxia drugs in vivo. The objective of the proposed project is to develop a 2nd generation (GEN-2) FD-NIRS instrument with improved speed and throughputs and validate it for longitudinal assessment of tumor hypoxia and the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy. We hypothesize that 1) the temporal profiles of hypoxia vary in different breast tumors and 2) biguanide drugs (e.g., metformin or phenformin) can reduce the oxygen consumption of breast cancer cells, thus improving their radiosensitivity. The following specific aims will be conducted to test the hypotheses: (1) to construct a 2nd generation FD-NIRS instrument with 10x speed and 15-dB better throughputs; (2) to quantify the characteristics of tumor hypoxia in orthotopic models of breast cancer; and (3) to assess the efficacy of metformin and irradiation in orthotopic models of breast cancer using the GEN-2 device. Our long- term goal is to develop a portable/wearable, low-cost FD-NIRS device that can aid in development and optimization of anti-hypoxia drugs and chemoradiotherapy. The successful completion of the aims will not only generate new knowledge about tumor hypoxia and lay the foundation for subsequent clinical studies to further delineate the role of hypoxia in cancer therapy, but also will enhance the biophotonics research and education at The University of Akron.",R15,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9023179,R15CA202605,R15CA202605-01,202605,,,2016,1,940,Tom,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1821,HL-132: Increasing Adherence to Guideline-Based Exercise Therapy For Chronic Heart Failure,"This proposal is in response to NHLBI Topics of Interest: HL-132 Advancing Research in Exercise Therapy for Chronic Heart Failure (R01). This proposal aims to optimize adherence to exercise regimens in heart failure (HF), improve physical functioning and quality of life, and reduce morbidity. HF is a major public health concern, and while survival has improved over the decades the absolute mortality rate for HF remains high at approximately 50% within 5 years of initial diagnosis. Numerous studies show that regular physical activity / exercise significantly improves exercise tolerance as well as clinical outcomes in HF. Exercise as a reliable adjunctive intervention, however, remains limited due to poor short- as well as long-term adherence. This proposed study will examine the effectiveness of the Heart Exercise And Resistance Training - Peer Lead ActivitY (HEART-PLAY) intervention to significantly sustain exercise adherence in HF patients, as compared to a more standard exercise intervention. The HEART-PLAY intervention will be adapted from previous NHLBI-funded R01 work shown to have a sustained impact on moderate physical activity in the elderly. This proposed study will adapt the intervention to be safe for HF patients, deliver the intervention in cardiology clinics, and test adherence to the program over 18 months. Clinic staff and HF patients who are appropriate role models will be trained to teach the intervention activities with trained health educators. They will then be responsible for maintaining the program in the cardiology clinics. The HEART-PLAY program and behavior change will be sustainable because of the presence of peer and staff leadership and because it employs proven strategies from social cognitive theory and ecological models including self monitoring, social support, role modeling, and relapse prevention. In contrast to exercise classes that have a fixed schedule and limited evidence for adherence, HEART-PLAY teaches patients how to accumulate meaningful physical activity across the day and provides a supportive social infrastructure to maintain motivation. In a rigorous cluster randomized controlled trial at cardiology clinics at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) hospitals and at the VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS), we will develop and assess the HEART-PLAY intervention program in 264 socioeconomically and ethnically diverse women and men 60+ years old with either HF with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) or HF with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF). Participants in the HEART-PLAY and in the STANDARD exercise programs will receive self-monitoring tools for aerobic plus resistance training as well as group education and materials. Participants in HEART-PLAY will additionally receive peer and staff leadership. We will demonstrate that the peer-led HEART-PLAY program based in the clinic setting will significantly enhance the primary study endpoint of adherence to 150 min/week of moderate physical activity/week over an 18-month follow up. We envision the study's findings will provide a successful intervention model that will be exportable to the clinic environment.!",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9448633,R01HL136407,R01HL136407-01A1,136407,A1,,2018,1,911,,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
1838,Preventing weight gain in U.S. Air Force personnel using a novel mobile health intervention,"Weight gain is disproportionately high among young adults (YAs) with average weight gain of 30 lbs. occurring between ages 18-35 and is associated with an early worsening of CVD risk factors. Primary prevention of weight gain is important because weight loss is difficult to achieve, access to programs is limited, and initially successful people regain weight over time. Weight gain is a serious problem in the Department of Defense, our nation's largest employer, with more employees than Walmart or Amazon. The military, comprised largely of YAs, has growing rates of obesity and yearly weight gain. Many people believe that young, active-duty men and women are fit, lean, and healthy because of the military lifestyle and protected from obesity. Unfortunately, obesity rates in active U.S. military personnel have mirrored those of civilians. Furthermore, inability to maintain a healthy weight results in early discharges and threatens the readiness of well-trained Airmen to be deployed. Overweight in the military is now considered a threat to national security. Few weight gain prevention (WGP) trials have been done in military populations, and previous trials with YAs have mixed results and poor external validity. Our proposal is designed to address the major public health problem of weight gain in the military, as well as address notable gaps in pragmatic mHealth and WGP trials. The SNAP- M intervention will be adapted, with partners and key stakeholder from the US Air Force, from our evidence- based WGP intervention for YAs, the Study of Novel Approaches to weight gain Prevention (SNAP). SNAP tested 2 self-regulatory interventions in 599 general population YAs and found that both reduced weight gain over 2-3 years compared to controls. This project proposes to make 1) critical adaptions to SNAP to facilitate translation and 2) conduct a Pragmatic Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness Trial of the SNAP-M intervention using a 2-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) design in 454 Air Force Airmen recruited from 4 military installations with the primary outcome of mean weight change from baseline to 2 years. We will compare the groups on key outcomes and examine potential moderators of treatment effect. Additionally, we will apply a RE-AIM Framework to determine reach and representativeness, and potential for organizational-level adoption, implementation, and maintenance of SNAP-M, if successful. The proposed research fills key research gaps in an underserved population in critical need of weight gain prevention with completely remote delivery suitable for YAs in the military.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10346255,R01HL161836,R01HL161836-01,161836,,,2022,1,954,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1842,Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning,"The objective of our work leverages mobile health technology to develop machine learning models for longitudinal trajectories of recovery like those needed in cardiac rehabilitation. The investigation uses mobile health technology to quantify trajectories of recovery measures, personalizing understanding of exercise capacity and cardiac function. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs reduce cardiovascular mortality risks and improve patient outcomes in such longitudinal fashion, through increased exercise capacity as measured by peak V02 improvements over the course of care. These programs have recently been extended to include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Despite the reduction in mortality and readmissions, participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge, especially in underserved communities because of limited program availability, the distance and transportation access to a program, its hours of operation, as well as a lack of diversity and gender-dominated programs. Home-based programs using smartphones have shown to increase adherence and achieve similar outcomes. While home-based programs also improved resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and levels of physical activity achieved through metabolic equivalent of tasks and peak V02 at the end of the study, users expressed a desire to have individualized education and treatment. Home-based systems still do not achieve real-time interaction, feedback, and monitoring that center-based rehabilitation does through a lack of feedback and necessity of self-reported exertion values. A system is needed that quantify measures of exercise capacity, which can lead to recovery, dynamically throughout the course of treatment. This proposal develops an unobtrusive system, with new mobile health technology sensors, and trains analytic models that allow for personalized quantification of rehabilitation trajectories in HFrEF patients, which can monitor patient adherence and improvement in measures during exercise as well as while at rest. This system investigates the improvement over the course of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation study and designs trajectories of recovery to understand improvements in peak V02 and exercise capacity in HFrEF patients by also measuring improvements of measurements of heart rate and blood pressure while at rest. This allows for an investigation of additional measures, over time, that may better quantify recovery in HFrEF patients that can be used for center-based rehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation. This can provide a significant enhancement of metrics that define recovery for HFrEF patients with estimations to metrics that are difficult to collect and evaluate.",R21,EB,NIBIB,EB,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9809933,R21EB028486,R21EB028486-01,28486,,,2019,1,956,Josh,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
1852,PeerNaija: A Mobile Health Platform Incentivizing Medication Adherence Among Youth Living with HIV in Nigeria,"The scale-up of global antiretroviral therapy (ART) represents an unparalleled global health success story, leading to impressive overall reductions in HIV-related morbidity and mortality. However, adolescents and young adults (AYA), especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa, have largely been left out of this story. While AIDS-related deaths declined by 30% for adults from 2005-2012, they increased by 50% among AYA over the same period, making AIDS the leading cause of death among African youth. AYA living with HIV perform poorly across the entire care continuum. ART adherence is central to effective HIV treatment, but AYA have high rates of virologic failure, virologic rebound after initial suppression, and attrition from HIV care. Unique developmental features of adolescence and young adulthood such as impulsivity, risk-taking, and poor concrete thinking make daily medication adherence even more challenging in this population. In addition, the attitudes and behaviors of young people are often strongly influenced by their peers. This influence can be seen as a powerful incentive for desired behaviors. Much of the literature has focused on financial incentives, which have shown success in promoting health behaviors. There are few data exploring mobile health (mHealth) technologies to exploit social and financial incentives, yet mHealth platforms allow for the delivery of novel behavioral interventions. With the proliferation of mobile phone ownership in Sub-Saharan Africa in general and in Nigeria in particular, such interventions can be delivered where there is greatest need. More than 75% of HIV-infected AYA live in Sub-Saharan Africa, and fully 10% reside in Nigeria. In this proposal, we will adapt an mHealth application, PEERNaija, to leverage both social and financial incentives to improve medication adherence among AYA living with HIV in Nigeria. We will also work with our partners at APIN Public Health in Nigeria to improve capacity to conduct independent mHealth research. The PEERNaija application will feature routine medication reminders, along with individual adherence monitoring with adherence scores, anonymized peer adherence scores (from peers attending the same clinic; social incentive), and a monthly lottery-based prize for youth with the highest adherence scores (financial incentive). To accomplish these aims, we will build on previous collaborations between Vanderbilt and APIN, a multi-site PEPFAR-supported program serving more than 250,000 persons living with HIV in Nigeria. We will engage key stakeholders in the community through focus groups and key informant interviews to guide iterative adaptation of the app. We will recruit a cohort of 50 HIV-infected AYA to pilot the app and assess feasibility, acceptability, adoption, and preliminary efficacy of important clinical measures (including adherence and virologic suppression). The proposed study will provide important preliminary data for the role of mHealth platforms to harness and deliver social and financial incentives to promote adherence efforts, especially for vulnerable youth, and for a larger intervention trial evaluating this app among HIV-infected AYA in Nigeria.",R21,TW,FIC,TW,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9771691,R21TW011327,R21TW011327-01,11327,,,2019,1,962,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1869,The Effects of a Cognitive Behavioral Healthy Lifestyle Intervention for Cardiovascular Risk Reduction in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Considerable research has indicated strong associations between posttraumatic stress and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) tend to show patterns of elevated CVD risk earlier in life than in the general population. The need for developing effective interventions for CVD risk-reduction in PTSD is increasingly evident. In comparison to the cumulative evidence concerning elevated CVD risk in PTSD, relatively little research has addressed CVD risk- reduction in this population. Adjunctive treatments, such as health behavior interventions, may be necessary as supplements to traditional psychotherapy for PTSD in order to reduce CVD risks. The objective of the proposed project is to examine the effects of a healthy lifestyle intervention that addresses multiple CVD-related heath behaviors among civilian adults across genders (ages 18+), who evidence PTSD and CVD risk at baseline. We will assess the intervention impact on both subjective and objective indices of health behaviors, cardiovascular risks and CVD markers over a one-year timeframe. The healthy lifestyle intervention addresses unique aspects of PTSD symptom presentation that serve as barriers to healthy behaviors (e.g., avoidance of physiological arousal/activation, viewing extra body weight as protection against abuse, nightmares/sleep disruption, and cognitive responses to stress), while encouraging healthy lifestyle changes. The primary goal of the present study is to examine whether, compared to a usual care psychotherapy control condition, utilizing the healthy lifestyle intervention as an adjunct to psychotherapy will result in significantly reduced CVD risks and improved CVD markers among civilian adults with PTSD and elevated CVD risks. Therefore, participants will be randomly assigned to either a usual care psychotherapy-only control condition or a usual care psychotherapy plus healthy lifestyle intervention condition. Outcomes will be assessed at post-intervention (12 weeks), as well as 6- month and 12-month time points for follow-up evaluation.",R15,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10515042,R15HL165308,R15HL165308-01,165308,,,2022,1,935,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1875,Investigating the Temperature Dependence of Age-related Tau Pathology Relevant to Early Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease that is increasing in prevalence with the aging population, characterized by the accumulation of Amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide associated plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein associated neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). This proposal seeks to link a known feature of aging, namely impaired thermoregulation and lower body and brain temperature, with this age-related increase in NFT pathology. Older age is associated with a long (10-20 year) preclinical phase before symptom onset, in which Aβ and NFT pathology increases and can be measured with tau PET and plasma markers. Extensive and compelling preclinical (rodent and in vitro) findings show that tau phosphorylation is strongly potentiated by small decreases in temperature (decreases in molecular kinetic energy), owing to the differing dependence of regulatory kinases and phosphatases upon this property. Other molecular processes that cause NFT formation may be similarly temperature dependent. We will build upon the results of our preliminary study in older adults that was motivated by these preclinical findings, providing, to our knowledge, their first human translation. Our preliminary results showed that lower telemetrically measured body temperature (Tb) during the hours the subject was awake - but not during sleep - strongly predicted (R2 = 0.47, p < 0.005) the amount of tau NFT tangles measured with [18-F]-MK-6240 tau PET-MR in early Braak stage areas in cognitively normal (NL) older adults. The purpose of the current project is to verify this strong relationship between lower waking Tb and NFTs, using the same methods, in a larger sample of older adults (n = 100, 50 female, 60-80 years) who are NL or have mild cognitive impairment. Briefly, subjects will undergo medical screening (Visit 1), followed by 7 days of home actigraphy for sleep-wake cycle characterization and further screening, and neuropsychological evaluation in Visit 2. In Visit 3, to take place over 48 hours, subjects will undergo Tb measurement with ingestible telemetric thermometry over 48 hours, simultaneous with two nights of nocturnal polysomnography to integrate Tb with the sleep wake state and measure slow wave sleep, followed by plasma tau and p-tau sampling the following morning. Subjects will be free to return home during the day in between sleep studies. At Visit 4, 18- F]-MK-6240 tau and amyloid PiB PET-MR scanning will be completed. We aim to 1)Verify lower waking Tb prediction of NFT in this sample, 2)Incorporate and account for the effects of Aβ plaque load (known to increase NFTs) and older age into the model, and 3)Test the extent to which the known relationship between Tb and sleep plays a role in Tb-NFT associations. This cross-sectional study will lay the ground work for future prospective studies to determine whether Tb based interventions can prevent the progression of NFT pathology toward reducing Alzheimer's Disease burden.",R01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10302079,R01AG070866,R01AG070866-01A1,70866,A1,,2021,1,938,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1878,SMS as an Incentive To Adhere (SITA),"HIV care requires high medication adherence to achieve optimal clinical outcomes such as slowing the progression to AIDS. Youths face special and unique challenges to adherence. Despite a wealth of interventions designed to increase adherence outcomes, few have focused on interventions that are sustainable in resource-limited settings, or for the period of adolescence. Developing ways to increase adherence rates among adolescents is particularly important as this groups experiences the fastest growth in new HIV/AIDS cases. Existing interventions often require scarce human resources, limiting their practical use. Novel ways of adapting traditional interventions in a sustainable manner are important in resource-limited settings, where second-line therapy is often too expensive or altogether unavailable. The recent rapid rise in mobile phone coverage and ownership among developing country populations has spawned the advent of mobile-phone based interventions to improve health service delivery; short message service (SMS)-based interventions have been found to increase adherence rates to ART among adult patients. However, more knowledge about this promising technology is needed as currently no clear-cut evidence exists about the pathways through which they work. The proposed study 'SMS as an Incentive To Adhere' (SITA) proposes novel ways of using SMS messages that are explicitly grounded in the theoretical framework of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). The first intervention is that of self-monitoring, i.e. providing participants with feedback about their adherence performance. Traditionally this involves clinic visits that take up provider and patient time and resources; SIT instead suggests providing objective, real-time information measured by electronic monitoring (Wisepill) devices sent to patients by weekly SMS. Such feedback builds self-efficacy, a key SCT concept and so may contribute to improved adherence. The second intervention is based on the SCT concept of social learning. Perceived group norms, and interventions that affect those perceptions, are a key influence on health behavior among youths, providing a substitute for direct learning. This approach is adapted to a mHealth environment by providing patients not only with their own adherence information but also that of a reference (peer) group. The first aim of the study is to hold focus groups with key stakeholders to tailor the SMS-intervention to the local needs of youths. The second aim planned is a small, six-month randomized controlled trial testing the two SITA intervention groups against a control condition of usual care to determine which method of informing and motivating drug adherence can best achieve its goals. The third aim is to synthesize lessons learned and discuss them with the clinics and other key stakeholders. The purpose of such capacity building and knowledge transfer activities part of this study is to build up mHealth knowledge at Mildmay and Uganda more generally to a point where ideas can be generated and implemented locally.",R21,MH,NIMH,TW;MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8809699,R21MH107218,R21MH107218-01,107218,,,2015,1,977,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
1882,"Afferent neurocardiac signals, cue reactivity, and cognitive control","This R21 application is in response to PA-20-196: NIH Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant Program, based on our discovery that a behavioral form of neuromodulation, termed 'resonance paced breathing,' alters brain activation during passive viewing of alcohol-related picture cues. Here we propose to determine the translational significance of this proof-of-concept finding by (1) measuring brain response during active cognitive processing in the context of alcohol cues and (2) testing the hypothesis that resonance breathing changes specific processing operations to reduce cue reactivity and support cognitive control. Multiple literatures support that these processes are mediated in part by a dynamic neurocardiac feedback loop termed the baroreflex, and that breathing paced at a resonance frequency of the cardiovascular system (~0.1Hz) modulates physiological responses to external stimuli. This knowledge has led to empirically supported long- term interventions for anxiety, depression, stress and other disorders (e.g., HRV biofeedback). Yet, the ability to use brief bouts of resonance breathing as a just-in-time intervention to alter attention to, and control over, appetitive cues is unknown. The public health significance of an accessible (via mobile app), brief, and easily trained technique to reduce alcohol cue salience is great, as cue reactivity and associated urges and craving are key precipitants of excessive drinking and relapse. We propose to test 100 binge drinking young adults (half female) in a within-subjects, repeated measures experiment to determine whether modulation of the afferent stream of the neurocardiac feedback loop through breathing paced at 0.1 Hz, compared to a control task, affects changes in neural cue reactivity and inhibitory control in the presence of salient alcohol cues. We will examine the effect of the 5-min intervention of 0.1 Hz resonance breathing task, and control task, on changes in the posterior contralateral N2 (N2pc) and P3b event-related potential (ERP) components as markers of attention allocation and motivational significance of attended stimuli using modified visual dot-probe and oddball tasks. Aim 2 will examine parallel effects on inhibitory control using the N2 component, elicited during a cued alcohol Go/NoGo paradigm. Primary hypotheses are that resonance breathing will diminish attention bias and motivational significance, and increase inhibitory control, when alcohol cues are encountered following the breathing task. Secondary analyses will explore the relation of individual differences in drinking patterns to intervention effects. If successful, this application will provide novel information about potential mechanisms through which resonance breathing is linked in a time-varying manner to neural systems that modulate cue reactivity. These preliminary data would provide premise for a larger scale study to examine the impact of resonance breathing in different high-risk populations of drinkers and its relation to drinking behavior change.",R21,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10316413,R21AA029604,R21AA029604-01,29604,,,2021,1,979,Josh,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1894,Development of a stage-specific adaptation of a self-stigma intervention for people recovering from a first episode of psychosis,"Self-stigma develops when people diagnosed with severe mental illnesses (SMI) become aware of negative stereotypes endorsed by many in society (e.g., dangerousness, incompetence, inability to work), perceive them as legitimate, and apply them to themselves. Clinically significant self-stigma affects roughly 1/3 or more of persons with SMI, and there is substantial evidence that it is strongly negatively linked to treatment engagement, as well as critical objective (e.g., social functioning) and subjective (e.g., self-esteem) dimensions of recovery. First Episodes of Psychosis (FEPs) typically occur during youth (between ages 15 and 24, corresponding with late adolescence/early adulthood), a time of heightened self-consciousness and a crucial period for identity formation. Developmental theory posits that identity disruptions, such as psychosis (with its associated negative stereotypes), may diminish one's sense of purpose, decreasing treatment engagement and impacting pursuit of life goals (school/work). Research with people who have recently experienced a FEP finds that clinically significant self-stigma is common at this stage and associated with diminished treatment engagement and impaired social functioning. The FEP period is therefore a critical time for addressing self-stigma given the potentially profound implications of self-stigma for identity development. Despite encouraging findings, treatment engagement and other outcomes are still suboptimal for targeted FEP services such as ""Coordinated Specialty Care"" [CSC]. Given the documented relationship between self-stigma and service engagement, it is plausible that targeted self-stigma intervention can increase engagement in CSC services and improve outcomes among youth with FEP. Narrative Enhancement and Cognitive Therapy (NECT) is an intervention designed to reduce self-stigma that was found to be effective compared to treatment as usual in recent randomized controlled-trials (RCTs) with middle-aged adults. NECT might serve as an effective adjunct to CSC, but it is not suitable for use with people with FEP in its current form, and may also be amenable to telehealth modification to better engage youth. The overall purpose of the proposed exploratory intervention development application, consistent with the aims of RFA-MH-18-706, is to conduct research that will inform the adaptation and preliminary testing of NECT modified for youth (aged 15-24) with FEP, targeting self-concept and illness conceptions to increase treatment engagement. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) Conduct a qualitative study to characterize experiences of stigma concern, self-stigma and associated intervention preferences among youth with FEP and their family members, 2) adapt NECT to be responsive to the needs and preferences of youth with FEP, and 3) Assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of the modified intervention (NECT-YA) combined with CSC services, compared to CSC services alone, in a small (n = 40) RCT.",R34,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10286084,R34MH122500,R34MH122500-01A1,122500,A1,,2021,1,985,Tom,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1906,"By Youth, For Youth: Digital Supported Peer Navigation for Addressing Child Mental Health Inequities","Despite significant progress in research, practice, and policy over the past few decades, many children and youth continue to experience poor mental health outcomes based on their socioeconomic disadvantage, ethnic or racial minority status, or immigrant status.

With their unrivaled ability to reach youth, school-based and pediatric primary care services are ideal hubs to provide mental health, healthcare, social services, and prevention to students and families who otherwise face barriers to care. Using Participatory Design and Community Partnered Participatory Research (CPPR), UCLA and UCSF psychiatry research centers with Los Angeles Trust for Children's Health and San Francisco Health Network propose to: (1) Fully co-design (with youth, caregivers, clinicians and other stakeholders) an innovative mental health digital tool, called 4Youth, to implement algorithmically supported mental health and social determinants screening and triage, resiliency apps and navigation activities AND help support the primary care-clinical workforce within school centers and pediatric services; (2) Study the implementation of two mental health navigation models separately (family navigaton+4Youth and youth navigation+4Youth), and their combined effectiveness for improving connecting and matching youth to the right level of care and supports. This project will be initiated with youth 11-24 years old and family and community members across 10 Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Wellness Centers and 10 San Francisco Health Network pediatric primary care centers, which serve mostly Black, Latino, and Asian children. Mobile technology approaches are gaining empirical support and hold great potential for enhancing mental health navigator models. Incorporating scalable digital health tools, and statistically evaluated algorithms to aid the navigation process, such as screening, triage, tracking, connecting to care, and multi-level communication, will help ensure youth are receiving optimal care that navigators, providers and other relevant systems can measure. A successful outcome of the project is a CPPR developed open-source intervention implementable in school-based and pediatric primary care services, for improving mental health services access for minoritized youth.",U01,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10414497,U01MH131827,U01MH131827-01,131827,,,2022,1,991,Tom,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1911,Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Risk for CVD and Stroke in the Jackson Heart Study,"Despite national initiatives to address health disparities, African Americans (AAs) suffer higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially stroke, than European Americans (EAs). The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) was established in 2000 with the aim of generating data that would support public health recommendations for reducing CVD disparities in AAs. This landmark study has reported a higher prevalence of diabetes and uncontrolled hypertension in this entirely AA cohort compared to other U.S. mostly EA cohorts. Increased risk factor prevalence is not explained by obesity or other traditional risk factors, suggesting a potential role for additional unmeasured factors in influencing adverse cardio- metabolic outcomes. Although JHS has comprehensively assessed a wide variety of CVD risk factors, a notable gap has been the absences of objective assessment of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep patterns. The importance of rectifying this gap is underscored by recent research from predominantly EA samples that have demonstrated that SDB and insufficient sleep each are associated with increased incidence of coronary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Our preliminary data also indicate that SDB may be more prevalent in the entirely AA JHS cohort than in predominantly white cohorts. Our long-range goal is to ameliorate CVD disparities by identifying ethnicity-specific modifiable risk factors. The proposed study will examine relationships among SDB, insufficient sleep, obesity, psycho- socio-cultural variables, and CVD risk factors in 1,200 members of the JHS cohort. Sleep apnea and sleep patterns will be objectively assessed using low burden but reliable in-home sleep apnea monitoring and wrist actigraphy. To assess intermediate measurements of CVD, particularly related to stroke and diabetes, intimal media thickness (IMT), blood pressure, and biochemical indices of glucose control and inflammation will be obtained using rigorous protocols. These data will be used to achieve three specific aims: (1) Identify risk factors for SDB and insufficient sleep in AAs, including novel measurements of major and minor stress and negative emotions relevant to minority populations; (2) Elucidate relationships between SDB severity, insufficient sleep, and risk for uncontrolled hypertension, stroke and diabetes; and (3) Quantify the extent to which SDB may statistically mediate relationships between obesity and traditional CVD risk factors. Our study will identify the role of sleep disorders as novel modifiabe risk factors for CVD in AAs, provide a basis for promoting better screening for SDB, and enhance scientific understanding of how disparities in stroke and intermediate CVD outcomes such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are impacted by sleep disorders. Finally, the results of our study will serve as the foundation for prospective analyses linking SDB to incident CVD events, morbidity, and mortality in AAs.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8868821,R01HL110068,R01HL110068-04,110068,,,2015,4,956,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1918,mHealth to Increase Service Utilization Among Recently Incarcerated Homeless Adults,"There is a significant revolving door of incarceration among homeless adults, a population with substantial health disparities. Homeless adults who receive the professional coordination of individualized care (i.e., case management) during the period following their release from jail experience fewer mental health and substance use problems, are more likely to obtain stable housing, and are less likely to be re-incarcerated. This is because case managers work to meet the various needs of their clients by helping them to overcome barriers to needed services (e.g., food, clothing, housing, job training, substance abuse and mental health treatment, medical care, medication, social support, proof of identification, legal aid). Many barriers (e.g., limited transportation, inability to schedule appointments, limited knowledge of available services) prevent homeless adults who were recently released from incarceration from obtaining available case management, crisis management, substance abuse, and mental health services. The proposed study will use mobile technology to address these barriers and fill gaps in the understanding of the causes of the revolving door of homeless incarceration. Specifically, 432 homeless adults who enroll in a shelter based Homeless Recovery Program after release from county jail will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: 1) usual shelter based case management (UCM), 2) UCM plus a study provided smart phone (UCM+SP), and 3) UCM with a study provided smart phone that is preloaded with an innovative care management app (SPCM). The SPCM app is an extension of the research team's previous successful work using mobile devices to assess and modify health behaviors in low income and homeless adults. Those assigned to SPCM will receive smart phones that will prompt (twice weekly) connections to shelter based case managers. The app will also offer direct links to care managers (available during normal business hours) and crisis interventionists (available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), with the touch of a button. It is hypothesized that SPCM will increase utilization of case and crisis management services thereby addressing unmet needs (e.g., alcohol/drug/mental health counseling), improve perceived social support and quality of life, and reduce homelessness and re-arrest. Another key focus of this study is to address gaps in the understanding of mechanisms that drive re-arrest and homelessness by using traditional in-person (i.e., baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months post-baseline) and smart phone based (i.e., daily for 6 months) assessment methods to identify distal and proximal predictors (e.g., affect, thoughts, behaviors, events) of continued homelessness and arrest. This research represents a step toward integrated service connection and healthcare service provision for one of the most underserved, high need, and understudied populations in the United States. Smart phone apps that increase the use of available healthcare services and identify predictors of key outcomes could be used to reach hard to reach populations with histories of significant and persistent health disparities (e.g., homeless adults).",R01,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9446364,R01MD010733,R01MD010733-01A1,10733,A1,,2017,1,997,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1919,Effects of Sleep Deficiency During Postpartum on Body Weight and Body Fat Changes in African American and White Women,"Obesity is associated with risks for several serious diseases, and excess visceral fat is known to be associated with risks for metabolic abnormalities. The literature suggests that women who do not return to pre-pregnancy body weight within 6 to 12 months after delivery are more likely to gain more weight in future years, and therefore have increased risk of becoming obese. Also, women who have given birth tend to have greater total fat and visceral fat compared to women who have not given birth, independent of body weight. Additionally, sleep deficiency during postpartum, likely related to caring for the infant, is common. Limited information in the literature suggests that short sleep and lower sleep efficiency in postpartum are associated with greater weight retention and higher adiposity at postpartum, independent of gestational weight gain and pre-pregnancy weight status. African American women are more prone to postpartum weight retention than White women. In addition, epidemiologic studies show that African Americans have shorter total sleep time and poorer sleep quality than Whites, and that short sleep is associated with greater likelihood of being obese in African Americans than Whites. Collectively, it is plausible that sleep deficiency contributes to the differences between African American and White women in postpartum weight and fat. The main goal of the proposed study is to examine whether differences in sleep during postpartum exist, and whether sleep deficiency affects weight and fat changes in postpartum differently between the two groups. African American and White women will be recruited, with baseline measurements occurring 6-8 weeks postpartum and follow up measurements at 4, 6, 9, and 12 months postpartum. Body weight will be measured at each time point, and body fat will be measured by dual energy-X-ray absorptiometry at 6-8 weeks and 6 and 12 months postpartum. Sleep will be assessed by actigraphy and validated questionnaires at each time point. Potential confounding variables, such as sociodemographic background, depression, self-esteem, stress, physical activity, dietary intake, breast feeding, and smoking status, will also be assessed. The specific aims of this study are: 1) to compare body weight, body fat, and sleep parameters between African American and White women from early to 12 months postpartum; 2) to determine the associations between sleep parameters and changes in body weight and body fat during the first year after delivery, and to explore whether the associations differ between African American and White women. Sleep parameters will include sleep duration and variables of sleep fragmentation and quality. The proposed study will be one of the first to comprehensively examine the effects of sleep deficiency, by assessing multiple sleep parameters in a longitudinal study, during postpartum on changes in body weight and body fat among both African American and White women. Results of this study will help examine the role of an understudied risk factor that may contribute to the differences in obesity-related health outcomes between African American and White women.",R21,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9526304,R21MD012740,R21MD012740-01,12740,,,2018,1,960,,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
1920,Development and utility of a wearable sensor for continuous monitoring of nutrients and hormones in subjects with chronic kidney disease,"Circulating nutrients, metabolites and hormones are both useful biomarkers for risk assessment and causal agents of chronic diseases including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cancer. The current methods for monitoring nutrients and hormones involve measurement of concentrations in blood samples and/or body fluids using benchtop instruments, such as automated Bioanalyzers and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) stationed in Clinical Diagnostic Labs, leading to discomfort and high costs associated with repeated measures. Recent advances in continuous glucose monitoring in skin interstitial fluid (ISF) have revolutionized the study of Precision Nutrition/Medicine and Circadian metabolism, due to the wearable nature and continuity of monitoring. Because of the costs associated with CKD progression (7% of Medicare expenditures) and the associated morbidity and mortality, the development of tools to continuously monitor nutrients, metabolites and hormones beyond the continuous glucose monitor is highly desirable in order to alter the course of CKD progression. It is therefore proposed to develop an innovative wearable multimodal sensing system for continuous monitoring of nutrients (sodium, potassium and calcium) and hormones, including 25OH Vitamin D (VitD), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). This high-risk/high-reward approach is fundamentally different from traditional method of periodic blood sampling for the trending of lab values and correlation with other clinical parameters. In the R21 phase (exploratory), wearable multimodal sensors will be developed for continuous monitoring of nutrients and hormones. The wearable sensors will be developed modeled on aptamer-based biosensors for continuous monitoring of individual small molecules and a minimally-invasive, microneedle-based potentiometric sensor for multiplexed and continuous monitoring of nutrients (sodium and potassium). In Aim 1, we will adapt and build on these biosensors for continuous monitoring of three nutrients (sodium, potassium and calcium) and three hormones (iPTH, FGF23 and VitD), simultaneously. A miniaturized print circuit board and associated electronics for wireless data communication with a smartphone App will be developed. In Aim 2, a deep recurrent neural network approach for joint multi-modal sensor data calibration will be utilized and the utility and reliability of wearable sensors validated in rat models. The R33 phase (Clinical Trial) will be undertaken based on achieving well-defined milestones in the R21 phase. In Aim 3, the device will be further refined and the ranges of skin ISF hormones in human subjects established. In Aim 4, the contribution of diet on nutrients/ hormones concentrations will be assessed and machine learning algorithms developed to predict CKD progression. The overall goal of these studies is to develop an innovative wearable multimodal sensing system for continuous monitoring of nutrients and hormones. This will set the stage for future work wherein these and other nutrients/hormones critical to chronic diseases can be modified, thereby fulfilling the promise of Precision Nutrition.",R21,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10425111,R21DK128714,R21DK128714-01A1,128714,A1,,2022,1,998,Pablo,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1945,"Food environment, diet quality and disparities in obesity","The role of neighborhoods in the development of obesity has received much research attention. Being able to identify those social and environmental variables that predict healthier weights can assist health promotion at community-level. This competing renewal of the Seattle Obesity Study (SOS) seeks to explain why obesity prevalence was closely linked to individual- and area-based socioeconomic status (SES), whereas 12 mo. weight change was not. The SOS III will recruit a longitudinal cohort of 1,000 adult residents of King, Snohomish, Pierce, and Yakima counties in WA State. The 4 counties are diverse in race/ethnicity, education, incomes, population density, patterns of development, and obesity rates. An address-based sampling scheme, stratified by SES, will yield a population sample that is >40% obese, while assuring geographic diversity. A 20-min Health Behaviors Survey will be administered by phone by Battelle Survey Research Center. Measured heights and weights will be obtained in-person at local sites at baseline, 12, and 24 mo. Participants will complete food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) at baseline, 12, and 24 mo. Prevailing supermarket prices for 384 FFQ foods in each county will be used to estimate individual diet costs at 3 points in time. GIS/GPS methods will track 3- day travel patterns and the time and location of all food events at baseline, 12, and 24 mo. Accelerometers worn over 3-days will track physical activity at baseline, 12, and 24 mo. Two follow-up Health Behaviors Surveys will be administered at 12 and 24 mo in-person visits. An environmental scan of the food environment using Info USA will be performed at baseline, 12mo and 24 mo. The SOS is one of few observational studies that combine longitudinal survey research with geo-localized metrics of environmental exposure, GPS tracking, accelerometers, and nutrition economics. SOS III will explore the impact of these variables on body weight trajectories over 24 mo. The first aim is to determine whether baseline SES and environmental variables predict subsequent changes in energy intakes, diet quality and cost, physical activity, and body weight. The second aim is to determine whether changes in social and environmental variables and in diet and physical activity behaviors can predict body weight trajectories over 24 mo. The third aim is to develop a new model explaining how changing exposure to socio-economic, environmental, dietary, and psychosocial variables can predict the dynamics of weight change. The SOS III will update and refine our metrics of the built environment and examine the relative impact of SES and the built environment on weight trajectories, using a mixed model framework.",R01,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,9026403,R01DK076608,R01DK076608-08A1,76608,A1,,2015,8,973,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
1946,Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement,"Post-treatment substance use disorder (SUD) relapse rates are high (40-60% at one year), with relapse occurring early (median time to relapse 1-3 months), indicating that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Telehealth and VR technologies have the ability to greatly increase the accessibility of highly engaging recovery support. Combining these two approaches provides a unique opportunity to create a highly engaging, cost-effective take home recovery support solution targeting the critical transition from inpatient care. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its existing highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app, to develop a convenient and cost-effective integrated take-home combined VR and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) that begins in the inpatient clinic. RecoVRi is designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from inpatient to home, thereby reducing the risk of relapse and associated health and monetary costs. Sober Grid is collaborating with TRIPP, Inc. to utilize TRIPP's immersive wellness platform. The design of the TRIPP experience leverages a large body of existing research on the use of VR technology in the mental wellness arena and utilizes proven mindfulness structures, targeted sound frequencies, visuals and interactions that have a multiplicative effect when administered through immersion. The Sober Grid Network will create a support wrapper to the VR experience that facilitates access to crisis management experts and community for the person in early recovery. The unique combination of a personalized and targeted self-regulation toolkit and community and professional support is a key differentiator for this service. In phase I of the project, we will develop and pilot test a proof-of-concept RecoVRi VR-mindfulness protocol and intervention to ascertain feasibility and acceptability (Aim 1). In phase II of the project, a production-quality intervention will be developed with new VR content created by the TRIPP development team specifically targeting themes supporting recovery from alcohol, stimulant and opioid SUD separately (Aim 2). We will then test post-treatment recovery support engagement in the RecoVRi intervention in comparison to treatment as usual in a randomized comparison trial involving 80 patients receiving inpatient treatment and transitioning to the home setting (Aim 3). Over the span of both phases, we will seek regulatory guidance from the FDA in order to attain clearance for use of the RecoVRi intervention as a therapeutic medical device (Aim 4).",R44,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9898123,R44DA050222,R44DA050222-01,50222,,,2019,1,1011,Chris,,,,,,,,,
1978,A Musculoskeletal Simulation Framework for In Silico Design and Optimization of a Soft Exosuit for Children with Muscular Dystrophy,"Muscular dystrophies (MD), such as Duchenne MD and Becker MD, are rare genetic diseases that cause progressive muscle degeneration in approximately 14 in 100,000 males ages 5-24. Currently there is no known treatment that can stop or reverse the damage caused by MD. Dystrophic muscle is especially susceptible to damage during eccentric contraction. Soft exosuits are an emerging class of wearable device that may be able to reduce eccentric contraction during functional movements such as downhill walking, which requires substantial eccentric knee extensor contraction. Exosuits utilize compliant textile-based actuators to inherently provide safety and comfort to the user, which is highly desirable for avoiding excessive muscle injury in boys with MD. However, one potential barrier to development of exosuits for boys with MD is the risk of injury during human subjects testing of new prototypes. Musculoskeletal simulations are an ideal tool for early-stage design of exosuits for children with MD because simulations provide characterization of muscle eccentric contraction, which is difficult to observe experimentally, and avoid risk of injury to human subjects when testing prototypes. Thus, the overall objective of this project is to develop a musculoskeletal simulation framework for in silico design and optimization of a soft exosuit for children with MD. First, existing simulations of healthy adults walking downhill will be modified to include a simulated soft exosuit. The initial exosuit design will be based on existing physical prototypes. A novel optimization framework will be used to optimize the exosuit to minimize eccentric contraction in the rectus femoris (a knee extensor) during downhill walking. Statistical analysis will be performed to test the hypotheses that (1) simulated eccentric contraction (i.e., net negative work) in the rectus femoris is significantly reduced by the exosuit and (2) eccentric contraction is further reduced following optimization. In addition, changes in joint reaction forces and eccentric contraction in other muscles will be quantified to investigate potential adverse side effects. After establishing potential benefits of the exosuit using the adult model, a musculoskeletal model of a child will be developed. A simulated isometric task will be used to calibrate maximum isometric muscle force in a typically developing and MD child model to match published strength data. Preliminary simulations of a child walking downhill with the exosuit will be generated by scaling the adult movement data using a retargeting algorithm. The exosuit optimization framework will be applied to both the typically developing child and child with MD models to determine whether the optimized exosuit provided a sufficient reduction in rectus femoris eccentric contraction to be statistically significant in future human subjects experiments. The proposed research aims to establish a foundation for design of an exosuit that can substantially improve quality of life for children with MD in the near term. In addition, the musculoskeletal simulation-based design optimization framework will facilitate rapid in silico design and testing of assistive devices, such as soft exosuits, without risk to human subjects.",R43,TR,NCATS,TR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10324878,R43TR003959,R43TR003959-01,3959,,,2021,1,1027,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
1982,A multi-level approach to improve HIV prevention and care for transgender women of color,"In the United States, transgender ('trans') women have high rates of new HIV diagnoses, with Black, Latina, and other trans women of color representing the majority of these cases. The HIV prevention and care continua emphasize the need for reducing HIV transmission risk via regular HIV testing, consistent condom use, and linkages to HIV prevention and care, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among HIV-negative individuals and antiretroviral therapy (ART) and viral suppression among people living with HIV. However, there is substantial drop-off at each step of these continua with trans women falling far behind in terms of PrEP use and viral suppression. Trans women of color experience intersectional stigma that results in unmet gender affirmation needs, which have been linked to disparities in HIV prevention and continua outcomes. Building on extensive formative work, this project seeks to test the efficacy of the Let's Be intervention, which is an integration of evidence-based, trauma-informed HIV prevention and treatment interventions, all of which have demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy with trans women. Let's Be is an HIV status- neutral intervention designed to mitigate the adverse health sequelae of intersectional stigma (including HIV stigma) thereby reducing sexual risk behaviors, increasing HIV prevention uptake (PrEP use), and treatment outcomes (viral suppression). Let's Be works at both the group- and individual-levels, comprising two peer-led components via telehealth: 1) the previously tested Sheroes status-neutral intervention, and 2) previously tested individual-level peer navigation adapted from the Healthy Divas intervention. We propose a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study focused primarily on testing the efficacy of Let's Be, while secondarily but simultaneously gleaning important lessons during implementation. Our primary outcome is PrEP adherence/viral suppression and our secondary outcome is a composite indicator of HIV risk that acknowledges there is not a singular effective prevention strategy that is appropriate or desired by all transgender women. We will recruit and randomize 250 trans women of color from San Francisco, California and Detroit, Michigan (stratified by city and HIV status), following participants for 12 months and collecting biological (i.e., dried blood spots to measure PrEP use or viral load) and behavioral data. Our community advisory boards composed of trans women of color will provide ongoing consultation. Our hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation design will inform implementation considerations to scale up Let's Be to other EHE jurisdictions, if effective. Findings will provide critical insights into the efficacy evaluation of an urgently needed trauma-informed multi-level status-neutral intervention delivered via telehealth in reducing disparities among trans women of color, one of the highest priority HIV prevention populations in the United States.",R01,MH,NIMH,OD;MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10546317,R01MH129285,R01MH129285-01A1,129285,A1,,2022,1,1029,Chris,,,,,,,,,
1991,Ocular Therapeutic Delivery Through Real-time Endoscopic B-scan OCT-guided Tools and Robotic Assistance,"Therapeutic protocols using gene therapy or stem cells for treating ocular diseases are still in their infancy, but promise a paradigm shift in treating a variety of visual disorders. Functional cellular preservation is expected to reduce progression of vision impairment, thereby reducing suffering and economic burden. With an aging world population, developing efficient and cost-effective therapies for age-related ocular diseases have become critical. Although less common, inherited retinal disorders cause untreatable vision loss in the young with only supportive care available. New molecular therapeutic agents for these and other blinding diseases present a potential for sight preservation. However, robust translatable injection techniques to enable pre-clinical researchers and clinicians to visualize and accurately deliver therapies to the favored subretinal location are lacking. A safe and accurate subretinal injection procedure is hampered by lack of simultaneous real-time visualization of the cross-sectional retinal layers and the needle tip. Moreover, subretinal injections require extreme accuracy and steadiness beyond the physiological tremor of most surgeons. Due to these perception and technical challenges, the current injection technique may disrupt adjacent anatomical structures. In addition, agent or cells may be injected into the incorrect layer or reflux through the internal retinal hole into the vitreous cavity. Such complications may negatively affect potential vision preservation. The reliability and safety of delivering ocular therapeutics are ongoing FDA concerns, which may affect advancement of the dramatically increasing treatments with >80 Investigational New Drug applications in 2015. Our goal is to directly address the FDA concerns by offering solutions to the critical accuracy barriers of perception and maneuverability by using a novel concept of a direct approach for subretinal injections using needles equipped with B-scan optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guided visualization and by using robotic assistance with online segmentation for localized therapeutic delivery. Our main hypothesis is that the proposed approach with technological augmentation of surgeons' visualization and manipulation skills for subretinal injections will enable a less invasive, more accurate, and safer therapeutic delivery procedure for ocular diseases. Aim I of our research includes the merging of novel B-scan OCT-guided needles with robotic assistance to achieve therapeutic delivery with minimal anatomical disruption. Aim II of our research includes testing our hypothesis by translating our systems to a preclinical porcine model to evaluate the role of visualization and maneuver augmentation in improving accuracy and time efficiency. This proposed work will develop efficacious OCT image-guided robotic-assisted surgical technologies and methods to enable the accurate delivery, of biologicals being discovered for future preventive, therapeutic and regenerative ocular treatments, with reduced procedural complexity and time.",R01,EY,NEI,EY,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9593113,R01EY028133,R01EY028133-01A1,28133,A1,,2018,1,996,,,,,,,,,,
1996,"The Home Evaluation, Assessment, Rating and Training of Gait (HEART-Gait) System for Monitoring Toe-Walking Severity in Children with Cerebral Palsy","2 Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of disorders attributed to non-progressive alterations occurring in the brain dur- 3 ing fetal and newborn development. These alterations affect movement, development and posture, causing 4 significant lifetime functional limitations. CP is the most common motor disorder in children, affecting 500,000 5 individuals in the US alone. Children with CP are commonly affected by gait impairments. One of the most 6 common impairments is equinus gait, or ""toe-walking"", which is characterized by predominantly plantarflexed 7 feet during the whole gait cycle. Different interventions are available to treat equinus gait in children with CP 8 and include physical therapy, orthoses, botulinum toxin injections and surgery. To determine which intervention 9 is most appropriate to restore mobility for a given patient, periodic gait evaluations are performed in the clinic. 10 This Phase I SBIR proposal will develop a wearable system (Home Evaluation, Assessment, Rating and Train- 11 ing of Gait, HEART-Gait system) that continuously monitors and analyses simple gait parameters in children 12 with CP outside the clinical laboratory and during normal daily activities, which will provide clinically useful out- 13 comes data not currently available and critical diagnostic data for determining intervention timing.

2006,A scalable aptamer-based electrochemical biosensor for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a critical global public health emergency and many countries are failing to contain the virus's spread due to slow and insufficient testing. While several diagnostic methods are now available, most tests are either reagent-intensive and must be done in CLIA-approved labs, making them expensive and slow to report results, or rapid and inexpensive, but potentially lacking in sensitivity. In the U.S., seriously ill and high- risk patients have been prioritized for testing, causing states to miss mild and asymptomatic cases, some of which are the most effective spreaders of the virus. However, expanding testing has been a challenge due to shortages of sampling swabs and key reagents for nucleic acid amplification-based tests, which are the most popular option. Testing capabilities must be expanded exponentially to enable mass population-level testing of all patients, healthcare workers and their families, other critical key workers, and the wider community in order to bring the pandemic under control. mPOD proposes to expand testing capabilities through a novel biosensor that will use oligonucleotide molecules called aptamers to bind to unique sites on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Aptamers have similar binding affinities to antibodies, but due to their smaller size, they are more agile, making them particularly suited for high-specificity binding. To complete the test, a saliva sample will be loaded onto a test strip containing aptamers immobilized onto gold electrodes. The gold-electrode test strip will be inserted into the mPOD DTCT, a proprietary electrochemical test platform where virus-bound aptamers will be detected via cyclic voltammetry, triggering a positive result. The result is sent wirelessly via a mobile app, which sends encrypted data on to the cloud for storage and to public health agencies for enhanced data collection, tracking, and tracing of COVID-19. The app will also include a backend database to help businesses, manufacturers, schools, and large institutions track tested individuals' results and tailor specific public health responses. In order to further develop this technology and enable rapid deployment for timely COVID-19 intervention, mPOD plans to 1) Select SARS-CoV-2-specific aptamers for use in electrode test strips with an optimized signal-to-noise ratio performance, 2) Demonstrate sensitivity and specificity of a low-cost, miniaturized potentiostat test strip for use as a COVID-19 POC or OTC diagnostic, 3) Complete and test a fully-fledged digital infrastructure for data collection, tracking, and tracing of COVID-19 test results via the mPOD mobile app. This non-traditional approach will provide new testing capabilities with the potential to report results faster than standard RT-PCR tests and with greater accuracy and sensitivity compared to existing antigen-based diagnostics. Furthermore, once the system is developed, test strips with customized aptamers can be developed for rapid diagnosis of other pathogens, including future emerging pandemics, via routine POC and OTC testing.",R44,DE,NIDCR,OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10266410,R44DE030842,R44DE030842-01,30842,,,2021,1,1042,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
2013,Eye movement dynamics: a rapid objective involuntary measure of concussion/mTBI,"Over 1.5 million sport-related mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) occur annually in the US, including 25,000 in high school athletes alone. Increased media and medical attention is focusing on these injuries and their potential to cause long-term cognitive, somatic and affective problems. While detection of the low level diffuse damage incurred through mTBI needs to take place accurately and quickly, assessment methods have been criticized as insufficiently sensitive and susceptible to motivational and other extraneous factors. Recent research suggests that oculomotor performance (e.g., eye movements such as saccades and smooth pursuit) may represent a sensitive biomarker of mTBI, yet it has yet to be tested in the real world athletic setting. The first aim of this study i to build and validate a sideline eye tracker that would be portable, low cost, and usable in direct sunlight. Using the sideline eye tracker, we will then evaluate the clinical utility of oculomotor performance as a rapid, objective, and accurate sidelines measure of mTBI among female and male high school and college level athletes. Specifically, we propose to conduct a double case-controlled, longitudinal comparison of 60 concussed athletes, 60 matched non-concussed athlete controls and 60 matched non-athlete controls over two seasons of athletic play, examining all three groups on oculomotor performance and a widely used mTBI diagnostic neuropsychological measure (the ImPACTTM test). The two athlete groups will be tested at baseline (pre-injury), post-injury, and post-season delay. The non-athlete control group will be tested at baseline and post-season delay. We will investigate the test-retest reliability of the oculomotor performance variables, document any change from baseline following mTBI, explore how oculomotor performance relates to cognitive performance (ImPACT test) and differs between the three subject groups, and examine whether change from baseline predicts recovery rate (days till return to play). Finally, we will conduct a preliminary examination of whether a multi-variate statistical model of oculomotor performance can classify subjects into concussed and non-concussed groups.",R21,DC,NIDCD,DC,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8785112,R21DC013974,R21DC013974-02,13974,,,2015,2,1047,Chris,,,,,,,,,
2023,"Stanford BSSR Pre-Doctoral Training Program at the Intersection of Data Sciences with Behavioral, Social, and Population Health Research","The mission of the Stanford BSSR Pre-Doctoral Training Program at the Intersection of Data Sciences with Behavioral, Social, and Population Health Research is to develop a cross-campus collaborative training program to provide talented pre-doctoral students with advanced specialized training at the intersections of social and behavioral health science, social epidemiology, data science, and population health. We are building a new team that spans the Stanford campus including faculty from 6 schools and 11 departments. We will provide a transformative multi-disciplinary predoctoral training environment that draws mentors from diverse fields (health and social psychology, medical sociology, social epidemiology, communications, health economics, business, education, law) and quantitative disciplines (computer science, informatics, statistics). The graduates of our program will have rigorous training in their own scientific disciplines, combined with extensive expertise working on a broad range of innovative research projects that rely on data of primarily two types: (1) intensive or voluminous longitudinal data from mHealth, smartphone and sensor technologies or electronic health records, and/or (2) large and complex data from internet, commercial, health administrative records, large population databases, internet data and social media platforms, crowd sourcing, and citizen science data. Predoctoral trainees in their first or second year of graduate studies will be admitted from programs in health psychology, medical sociology, social/behavioral epidemiology, health economics or another social science discipline. We are requesting support for 5 pre-doctoral students per year whose training will last 2 or more years. They will emerge from the program with a thorough understanding of their own fundamental discipline combined with advanced expertise in cutting-edge statistical and computational methods for analyzing increasingly complex and multidimensional longitudinal sets. The training program components will include both department or discipline-specific training in addition to program-wide data science components including: (1) innovative curriculum, including specialized quantitative curriculum customized to the experience and background of each trainee; (2) a mentored research experience with a dual mentor model (one disciplinary mentor, one methodological mentor); (3) exposure to team science approaches to problem solving, including design thinking, cross-disciplinary collaborations, and team building; (4) experiential components, including availability of Stanford dry-lab rotations and short-term internships in Silicon Valley companies; (5) forums for intellectual exchanges; and (6) many opportunities to develop professional skills in grant writing and collaboration.

2046,Smart Residential Carpet for Promoting Aging in Place,"Aging in place, or the ability of older adults to continue to live safely and economically in their own residences for as long as possible, is one of the key issues of modern societies. Continued population growth of older adults (age 65+) will lead to significant financial and logistical burdens on the nation's healthcare system. As the population ages, there will be a greater need for preventive, acute, rehabilitative, and long-term health care services for older adults, as well as a need for tools to enable them to function independently during everyday activities. Tele-monitoring devices for aging in place have gained in popularity in recent years, including devices for home rehabilitation, remote monitoring, social well-being, and fall detection/prediction. However, encouraging older adults to use these devices is still a difficult task. One of the challenges of current tele-monitoring devices is extended continuous monitoring over months or years. Furthermore, there are key implementation limitations for aging in place technology: false alarms, privacy concerns, vision obstruction/occlusion, the need to use the device for long periods of time, finite battery life, an RF communication failure. Recent advances in smart textiles have opened new avenues to address the challenges of conventional tele-monitoring systems. We propose to design and commercialize a residential wall-to-wall and up-the-stairs smart carpet that will substantially improve the ability of older adults to safely age in place. The smart carpet will be able to detect falls, monitor the ability of a person to rise from the floor, and predict when the risk of falls ad frailty are significant based on gradual changes in motor performance. This system can also generate alerts to request immediate assistance when needed with minimal false alarms. In our pilot study, Dr. Najafi (contact-PI) and his team at the Interdisciplinary Consortium on Advanced Motion Performance (iCAMP), University of Arizona, designed a small scale smart carpet using highly flexible conductive yarn (patent pending). In this STTR-Phase I, we will design and build a larger scale smart carpet prototype (300cm×300cm with pixel resolution of 1cm2) suitable for proof of concept clinical trials to demonstrate its accuracy in detecting postural transitions, sitting, standing, gait, falls, etc. During Phase II, a full-size smart carpet, suitable for residetial use and home tele-monitoring, will be designed and clinically validated for assessing fall risk, frailty, and automatic fall detection during daily home use. The proposed technology will have a significant impact on the ability of older adults to age in place. The smart carpet will screen for fall risk and frailty in older adults, which will lead to timely intervention. Furthermore, this capet can potentially reduce the number of falls among this population, which would help alleviate healthcare costs in older adults as well as improve quality of life by allowing them to remain in their homes. Continuous in-home tele-monitoring will also reduce the possibility of injury or death in older adults by requesting immediate assistance after a fall. Finally, this technology wil provide peace of mind to older adults by reducing their fear of injury and enabling them to feel comfortable aging in place, thereby improving their quality of life.",R41,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9139716,R41AG053108,R41AG053108-01,53108,,,2016,1,1082,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
2047,"Energy Reserves, Physical Activity, and Alzheimer's Disease in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Underlying pathological and physiological changes related to the onset and progression of AD are believed to emerge several years prior to clinical manifestations. Gait abnormalities and motor slowing typically precede the diagnosis of AD by a decade or more, presenting the exciting possibility that changes in gait may act as early noninvasive biomarkers for AD. Previous work by our group has identified key markers of impending and/or accelerated gait speed decline based on physiological measures of the energy cost of slow walking, peak energy capacity, and quantities and patterns of objectively measured free-living physical activity (PA), making them potential preclinical markers of early AD pathology. We propose to use 8 years of existing longitudinal data, and ongoing/new data collection in nearly 1,000 older adults in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), to examine the roles of altered energy reserves, and reduced and fragmented daily PA as precursors to clinical markers of Alzheimer's disease and neuronal injury, which include Aβ deposition using [11C]-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography, brain atrophy using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive performance. We will also explore potential vascular mechanisms linking energy reserves and PA to these outcomes, including cerebral blood flow, ankle brachial index, and pulse wave velocity, as well as the role of mediating or modifying factors such as inflammation and the apolipoprotein E genotype. The BLSA is a continuously enrolled cohort study of aging that already contains repeated measures of cognition and adjudication of cognitive status, in which a subset completes repeated MRI and PiB PET scans. Importantly, our preliminary cross-sectional data from the BLSA indicate strong associations among energy reserves, cognitive performance, b-amyloid burden, and diurnal patterns of daily PA. We propose to investigate the longitudinal associations among these variables to identify physiological thresholds of poor energy reserve and reduced and fragmented patterns of diurnal PA as early precursors to the onset and progression of AD pathology. A better understanding of the association between energy reserves/PA, subclinical AD pathology, and cognitive performance may elucidate a physiological threshold of diminished energy reserve that is associated with increased risk of poor cognitive outcomes over time, and increase our understanding of the complex association between declines in physical and cognitive functioning with age. Moreover, uncovering patterns of daily free-living PA most commonly associated with this threshold will help define a phenotype of reduced and/or fragmented PA that signifies impending emergence and progression of AD. Given the proliferation of wearable devices to monitor PA in the consumer and research markets, identifying changes in PA consistent with the development of AD pathology could provide evidence for future wide-scale screening for early detection of persons at high risk of AD.",U01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9421913,U01AG057545,U01AG057545-01,57545,,,2017,1,1083,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2049,Reducing Parenting Stress to Facilitate Justice-Involved Youth's Treatment Engagement,"Justice-involved youth exhibit high rates of substance use and mental health symptoms, yet few receive treatment during detention or community re-entry. Once released into the community, caregivers must facilitate youth's treatment engagement, mobilizing significant resources and facing many barriers (e.g., transportation, mistrust) to do so. Parenting stress, which is heightened during youth detention and community reentry, is associated with greater perceived barriers to treatment, less youth therapeutic change throughout treatment, and premature treatment dropout. Addressing parenting stress improves youth treatment engagement and outcomes among youth exhibiting antisocial behavior, yet given the many barriers to treatment, novel approaches to intervention are needed; mobile health (mHealth) technology is one promising approach. Caregivers of justice-involved youth and system stakeholders are interested in mHealth treatment and mHealth addresses instrumental barriers (e.g., transportation) to treatment. Advances in technology and community engaged research allow for active stakeholder collaboration in mHealth application development, with no technological expertise required, through participatory informatics; caregiver involvement increases the likelihood the intervention will be relevant and efficacious. The purpose of this mixed-methods K23 study is to 1) develop a mHealth parenting stress intervention using participatory informatics; 2) assess the feasibility and acceptability of the participatory informatics approach and the intervention; 3) evaluate the intervention's preliminary efficacy in reducing parenting stress and increasing youth engagement in substance use or dual diagnosis treatment post-detention through a pilot RCT; and 4) understand systems-level factors that could influence eventual system adoption and sustainability. The overall goal of this K23 application is to provide protected, mentored time to expand Dr. Johanna Folk's (PI) capacities as an independent substance use health services researcher with expertise using participatory research methods to develop and evaluate novel interventions to engage justice-involved youth and families into youth substance use treatment. Dr. Folk will work with a team of experienced and knowledgeable mentors (Drs. Tolou-Shams, Aguilera, Knight, Arevian, and Chaplin) to increase her competency in: 1) substance use services research; 2) participatory research methods; and 3) mHealth methodology. The proposed research study is a logical extension of Dr. Folk's program of research to date which has spanned the developmental spectrum and focused on the complex interplay between justice involvement, substance use, mental health, and interpersonal relationships. This early career development award will provide the necessary candidate training and foundation for a larger R01 hybrid design clinical trial testing the efficacy of the mHealth parenting stress intervention designed during the K23, propelling a federally-funded program of research designed to increase substance use treatment engagement and improve behavioral health outcomes for justice-involved youth and families.",K23,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10127403,K23DA050798,K23DA050798-01A1,50798,A1,,2021,1,1085,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2063,A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,"This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity ""to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition."" This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention.",U01,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,9391516,U01AA014834,U01AA014834-14,14834,,,2017,14,1099,Chris,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2067,Building Capacity in Human-Centered Design: Developing a Diabetes mHealth Application for and with Kenyan Adolescents,"With over 6 billion mobile phone subscribers and 75% of the world having access to a device, global health communities increasingly recognize the potential for using these devices to improve access to health care and health outcomes-especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where device ownership has grown dramatically. Less attention, however, has been given to developing the research capacity to allow these countries' public health researchers to collaborate with software developers and the users of mHealth applications (henceforth apps) to develop their own interventions. If mHealth apps are to be adopted, effective, and scalable, they must be designed by and with these individuals, the people most knowledgeable about the issues affecting technology use and disease management in their countries. Human-centered design (HCD), or design thinking, is a promising design strategy that prioritizes the needs of the intended population. It has also been successfully used to develop innovative and locally relevant health interventions that improve health outcomes. The purpose of this R21 proposal is to introduce Kenyan public health researchers and software developers to the HCD process and then collaboratively develop and evaluate an mHealth app that targets a growing epidemic among middle-to-late adolescents (13-18 yrs.) in Kenya-Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). To achieve this goal, we will pursue these specific aims: (1) train Kenyan health practitioners and software developers in HCD; (2) use HCD to build a prototype mHealth intervention for adolescents in Kenya with T1D; and (3) assess the prototype's usability, accessibility, and feasibility in using it to increase adolescents' knowledge of T1D and management of the disease. Our long-term goals include: (1) building research capacity by establishing a research network between health researchers at The Kenyan Diabetes Management and Information Center (DMI-a non-profit organization that works with adolescents with T1D) and mobile software developers at LakeHub (an innovation space in Kisumu) so they can design future mHealth apps; (2) developing a commercially available app that Kenyan adolescents can use to manage T1D and stay healthy; and (3) evaluating the HCD process as it applies to developing mHealth interventions that improve health outcomes.",R21,TW,FIC,TW;OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9773492,R21TW011339,R21TW011339-01,11339,,,2019,1,1103,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
2071,Treatment Options for Insomnia for ESRD,"Patients with end-stage renal disease treated with hemodialysis (HD) report poor health-related quality life, in part because of the large number of troubling symptoms they experience. One of the most frequently reported such symptom is insomnia and includes patients' difficulties in falling asleep, frequently waking up after falling asleep, and early morning awakening. There are unique issues pertaining to HD treatments and schedules that disrupt regular sleep/wake routines and contribute to the high prevalence and severity of insomnia. A large body of evidence from HD patients and other populations also indicate that insomnia is associated with fatigue, daytime sleepiness, pain, depressive symptoms, and a higher risk for death. Despite evidence for broad- ranging health effects of insomnia, no clinical trials have tested the efficacy of treatments for HD patients. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as first line therapy but is inaccessible to HD patients in the United States as they have to commit to thrice weekly dialysis treatments in community- based dialysis facilities; CBT-I delivered by telehealth can overcome the barriers but its efficacy has never been rigorously tested for any patient population. Pharmacotherapy is the most widely used treatment for insomnia for HD patients - while some drugs presently used are unsafe as they are associated with a higher risk for death for this patient population (benzodiazepines and zolpidem-like drugs), the efficacy of others (trazodone) has never been tested for HD patients. With this application, we propose to test the short- and long-term comparative effectiveness of 6-week treatment with telehealth CBT-I, trazodone, or medication placebo. This will be accomplished with a randomized controlled clinical trial in which 125 HD patients with chronic insomnia treated in community-based dialysis facilities in Seattle and Albuquerque will be assigned 2:2:1 to telehealth CBT-I, trazodone, and medication placebo, respectively; short-term effectiveness will be determined at the end of 6-weeks of treatment and long-term effectiveness at 24-weeks. Telehealth CBT-I will be delivered through a mobile platform, iHOPE, by English and Spanish-speaking therapists. The primary and secondary patient reported outcomes will be assessed with computer-based telephone interviewing by research scientists blinded to treatment assignment. The study will be conducted under the oversight of highly experienced Clinical and Data Coordinating Centers in Seattle with a strong track record of patient enrollment and retention in clinical trials, and implementing behavioral interventions with high fidelity to the protocol. This clinical trial will provide the first evidence for the comparative effectiveness of two distinct approaches in improving insomnia and other patient-reported outcomes for HD patients. It will also be the first rigorous evaluation of telehealth CBT-I, a readily scalable approach not only for HD patients but also for other patient populations with difficulty accessing treatment for insomnia.",R01,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9421923,R01DK115468,R01DK115468-01,115468,,,2018,1,1107,Chris,,,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
2072,Optimizing a couples-based mHealth intervention for weight management,"Weight is a dyadic health issue in married and cohabitating couples. Partners tend to enter this critical interpersonal relationship with a similar weight status and gain weight together over time. Despite this shared risk, standard behavioral interventions focus on individuals, not couples, largely ignoring the inherently dyadic nature of weight management. Early tests of couples weight loss programs lacked a clear conceptualization guiding spouse/partner involvement and results were mixed. Yet there are promising signals - theoretical and empirical - to guide how couples' relationships can be harnessed to improve weight loss outcomes. The proposed study aims to build on this work and develop an efficacious couples-based mHealth approach to weight loss using the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework. In the preparation phase, we developed a conceptual model drawing on Transactive Goal Dynamics Theory, our own pilot work, and the published literature that includes four dyadic intervention components: dyadic action planning, joint feedback on goal progress, autonomy support training, and home environment modifications. In the proposed optimization phase, we plan to conduct an innovative and efficient factorial experiment to identify which combination of the four dyadic intervention components - when added to the core components of a standard behavioral weight loss program (BWL; e.g., weekly lessons, self-monitoring, feedback) - results in the greatest weight loss at 6 months (primary outcome). The 6-month intervention will be delivered to married and cohabitating couples (N=368 dyads) via a native smartphone app to enhance the reach of the intervention, minimize burden, and attract couples with more demographic and relationship diversity. Assessments will occur at 0, 3, and 6 months. Weight loss and theoretical mediators as framed by Transactive Goal Dynamics Theory (e.g., goal coordination) will be assessed along with hypothesized moderators (relationship and demographic variables). The set of novel dyadic intervention components that maximizes weight loss will be selected for inclusion in an optimized intervention package to be evaluated in a future randomized controlled trial. The proposed study is the first test of a fully mHealth weight loss intervention for married and cohabitating couples. Using the MOST design, it will advance both intervention and theory development by isolating active dyadic intervention components and their mechanisms of action.",R01,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10422940,R01DK132386,R01DK132386-01,132386,,,2022,1,1108,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
2077,Life Enhancing Activities for Family Caregivers of People with Dementia,"Family members provide the vast majority of informal care to people with dementia and experience significant caregiving-related stress that contributes to mental and physical illness and increases their risk of death. As the number of people diagnosed with dementia is expected to exceed 11 million by 2050, there is a growing need for interventions that can effectively buffer these negative psychological and physical consequences in informal caregivers. The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to test the Life Enhancing Activities for Family Caregivers (LEAF) intervention, a positive emotion skill-building program designed to improve psychological well-being (positive and negative affect, stress, burden, strain, mood) and coping. The LEAF one-hour training sessions will be conducted weekly for 5 weeks by a trained facilitator. The skills include: noticing and capitalizin on positive events, gratitude, mindfulness, positive reappraisal, personal strengths, and acts of kindness. The intervention is unique in that it is delivered via video conference, as opposed to in-person, which vastly increases the accessibility for caregivers. Also, the nature of the skills taught enable caregivers to use them at any time without needing to schedule an appointment with a provider, travel to a facility, arrange coverage for caregiving in their absence, or incur ay additional financial liability associated with service utilization. Given that sociodemographic factors, specifically age and geographic location, can influence individual caregiver's experiences, the study will test the effects of the LEAF intervention in a diverse cohort of informal caregivers of individuals with dementia. The specific aims are to: 1) Test the effect of the LEAF intervention compared to the wait list control condition on psychological well-being (positive and negative affect, stress, burden, strain, mood) and coping at end of intervention and 1 month post intervention; 2) Test the effects of caregiver age and geographic location on psychological and coping outcomes; and 3) Assess the longer-term effects of the LEAF intervention on psychological well-being and coping outcomes at 3 and 6 months post intervention. The LEAF intervention has the potential to substantially decrease the public health burden of caregiving. It is innovative in numerous respects in that it focuses on positive emotion, focuses on the caregiver, and has the potential for sustained beneficial effects. It is also easily accessible to geographically dispersed caregivers whose responsibilities and remote location often pose barriers to participation in more traditional caregiving interventions.",R01,NR,NINR,NR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8858687,R01NR014435,R01NR014435-03,14435,,,2015,3,1113,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,

My current research projects in Dr. Fay Horak's laboratory focus on quantifying prescribed balance and gait tasks with body-worn sensors in subjects with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). My long-term career goal is to establish my own independent laboratory, and objectively characterize, understand, and monitor mobility impairments in patients with neurological disorders by means of wearable sensors, in order to develop tailored rehabilitation interventions, such as biofeedback-based solutions. The current project aims to characterize gait disturbances in PD, such as Freezing of Gait (FoG), and apply a vibrotactile biofeedback as a rehabilitation intervention. The K99 phase of the proposed project will perform laboratory studies in healthy control subjects and subjects with PD to characterize locomotion, FoG episodes (Aim I) and to determine the effects of enhanced proprioception, with phase-dependent vibrotactile biofeedback, on gait disturbances (Aim II). The K00 phase of the project will then translate results of the K99 phase to characterize locomotion and FoG in PD subjects' home environment (Aim III) and explore the possibility of improving locomotion with biofeedback during normal daily activities (Aim IV). To achieve my goal, I need to gain expertise in issues related to clinical and translational research, in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, and to refine my signal processing skills. I also need additional training in grantsmanship and writing related to clinical problems. My experienced team of mentors will be critical to the success of this project. Dr. Fay Horak, Ph.D., PT, and Dr. John Nutt, MD, are two of the preeminent researchers in the study of balance and gait disorders in Parkinson's disease, with a long history of productive collaboration, continuous NIH funding, and successful mentoring.

2104,Optimizing medium-chain lipids for the treatment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders,"Long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAODs) are a heterogenous group of disorders characterized by the inability to break down long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria for energy. The primary tissues affected are liver, heart, and muscle. These disorders are identified at birth through newborn screening programs. Treatment consists of fasting avoidance and replacing long-chain fats in the diet with medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA). Despite decades of orally dosing patients with MCFA-containing oils, it is not understood how MCFA are metabolized by liver, muscle, and heart. Further, the rigor of the experimental evidence regarding the therapeutic efficacy of oral MCFA is low. In mouse models of LC-FAOD, oral MCFA do not improve cardiomyopathy or the capacity for exercise. Human patients likewise still suffer from muscle symptoms and rhabdomyolysis. In the current proposal it is postulated that there are two major problems with current MCFA-based therapies. First, muscle and heart are not equipped to metabolize exogenous MCFA. Second, orally-administered MCFA are nearly completely absorbed by the liver and do distribute to heart and muscle. It is hypothesized that MCFA therapy can be optimized to treat cardiomyopathy and rhabdomyolysis through the exploration of alternative medium-chain lipid species and alternative routes of delivery. The hypothesis is supported by preliminary data showing that heart and muscle prefer carnitine conjugates of MCFA (MC-carnitines) over free MCFAs, and a demonstrated improvement in muscle function of LC-FAOD mice upon subcutaneous injection of an MC- carnitine. This hypothesis will be fully explored in three Specific Aims: 1) Determine the optimal medium-chain lipid species for liver, heart and muscle; 2) Determine the bioavailability and biodistribution of orally versus subcutaneously-administered medium-chain lipids; and 3) Determine the therapeutic efficacy of medium-chain lipids in LC-FAOD mice. Aim 1 is expected to show that liver prefers free MCFA as substrates, while muscle and heart prefer MC-carnitines. The differential preference is proposed to be due to the presence of mitochondrial medium-chain acyl-CoA synthases in liver but not heart or muscle. Aim 2 is expected to demonstrate that subcutaneous delivery of medium-chain lipids greatly increases bioavailability and subsequent biodistribution to the periphery. Finally, in Aim 3, pre-clinical testing of LC-FAOD mouse models is expected to document the therapeutic advantage of the optimized substrates from Aim 1 and the subcutaneous delivery from Aim 2.

2107,Patient-centered mobile technology interventions to improve maternal health in Uganda,"Antenatal care (ANC) is a mainstay of preventing maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality but utilization of these services in Uganda remains low. Consequently, maternal and perinatal mortality rates are among the highest in the world. Short message service (SMS) and other mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been proposed to promote positive health behavior and strengthen informed decision- making for women in the perinatal period. Such interventions are hypothesized to improve outcomes through knowledge transfer and strengthened access to social support. However, few evaluations of mHealth interventions to improve maternal care have been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, where social and contextual factors that drive successful interventions differ, and the public health impact of such interventions is likely to be great. Few studies have also examined theory-informed methods to develop interventions to maximize end-user acceptability. Candidate: I am a lecturer at Mbarara University of Science and Technology with basic training in epidemiology, research methods and data analysis, resulting in 12 publications (6 first- authored). I am applying for this K43 award to secure training and mentorship in developing and adopting low cost, context-specific novel interventions to improve maternal-child health in low resource settings. Mentoring: To accomplish this goal, I have identified a strong mentorship team with expertise in reproductive health (Drs. Matthews & Mugyenyi), mHealth, methodology and epidemiology (Dr. Siedner), qualitative methods (Dr. Ware), career development and project implementation (Professor. Obua). Leveraging this strong team of multidisciplinary mentors and formal didactics in the identified focus areas of training will enable me to obtain requisite skills and hands-on experience to inform, design, adopt and test novel intervention strategies to improve maternal-child health in low resource settings. Training: I require additional experience, mentorship and training in: 1) qualitative methods to elicit end-user feedback for development of interventions, 2) technology acceptance for patient-centered intervention development and evaluation, and 3) experimental study designs to evaluate interventions in pregnant women. Research: I propose to 1) conduct a qualitative study to identify barriers and facilitators to women's engagement in ANC, decisions to deliver in health facilities, and characterize their preferences for an mHealth-based, social support intervention; 2) develop and iteratively evaluate the intervention based on these qualitative results; 3) pilot test the intervention to assess feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy to improve ANC utilization and skilled births. This training and results will position me to write an R01 application in year 5 of this award to evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth-based social support intervention compared to routine care to improve maternal and child health outcomes in Uganda. My ultimate goal is to become an independent investigator, with expertise in development and evaluation of culturally informed solutions to reduce maternal-child mortality.",K43,TW,FIC,TW,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9596970,K43TW011004,K43TW011004-01,11004,,,2018,1,1143,Chris,,,,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
2111,DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTIMODAL MOBILE SLEEP INTERVENTION USING WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE HEAVY DRINKING IN YOUNG ADULTS,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) onset peaks during young adulthood. Young adults report more frequent, heavier alcohol use than older adults and experience substantial negative consequences (e.g., accidental injury) and risk of developing a chronic AUD. Current young adult alcohol intervention strategies, however, have modest effects. To address this gap, we propose to develop a novel, mobile sleep intervention for heavy-drinking young adults. Sleep may be a useful treatment target for this population for several reasons. Poor sleep is common among young adults who drink heavily and an AUD risk factor. Young adults are also interested in information to help them sleep better. Further, as a standard practice, behavioral sleep interventions address alcohol use and may provide a gateway for intervening on alcohol use. We conducted a preliminary test of a mobile sleep intervention in 42 heavy-drinking young adults. The primary components were: (1) brief, web- based sleep hygiene advice including the standard advice to moderate drinking for better sleep and (2) daily web-based sleep and alcohol self-monitoring plus wearing a sleep/wake activity tracker daily. Our results demonstrated promising effects on drinking and sleep. The next phase of intervention development involves testing our intervention components compared to matched control conditions and whether a new component suggested by participants in post-treatment interviews further improves outcomes. Specifically, participants indicated a preference for personalized feedback about their sleep diary and tracker data and the connections with alcohol use. Additionally, exciting new alcohol biosensor technology has emerged that allows continuous tracking of blood alcohol level and provides an objective measure of participant alcohol consumption. Through this technology we can provide personalized alcohol-sleep interaction feedback using both objective sleep/alcohol trackers and sleep/alcohol diary data. The current proposal will develop and test a mobile sleep/alcohol self-monitoring + sleep/alcohol data feedback intervention in 120 heavy-drinking young adults. All participants will wear sleep and alcohol trackers daily. The primary intervention will include: (1) web-based sleep hygiene advice + sleep/alcohol diary self-monitoring + sleep/alcohol data feedback. This condition (n=60) will be compared to the matched control conditions that only include these components: (1) web-based sleep hygiene advice (n=30) or (2) web-based sleep hygiene advice + sleep/alcohol diary self-monitoring (n=30). The primary objective is to evaluate sleep intervention component feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy on alcohol outcomes to inform a Stage II randomized trial comparing the final sleep intervention with a standard alcohol intervention. This study is in line with NIAAA's strategic interest to identify novel targets to improve alcohol prevention and intervention efforts for young people. Ultimately, this research could result in an efficacious, low-cost intervention that has broad population reach through the use of technology and a substantial public health impact by reducing AUD risk at a crucial developmental stage.",R34,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9528805,R34AA026021,R34AA026021-01A1,26021,A1,,2018,1,1148,Leonie,,,,,,,,,

Stanford is in dire need of a new triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, to replace a 15- year-old instrument at Stanford University Mass Spectrometry, the campus-wide shared resource. Mass spectrometers are generally considered aged at 5 years and obsolete at 8 years. Our expert staff has been able to make the best use of our long-obsolete model, which has lasted unusually long in our hands, but the need to modernize our triple quadrupole capability is now critical. The proportion of NIH-funded biomedical research projects that cannot be addressed using our current instrumentation is rising by the month. The required analytical sensitivity is simply not there; modern instruments are over three orders of magnitude more sensitive than what we have on campus today. Numerous projects, with current NIH funding, are being delayed or postponed simply due to lack of an appropriate instrument. The technical expertise, physical infrastructure, and administrative processes are all in place and ready to immediately put this new mass spectrometer to work on NIH-funded biomedical research projects, including childhood health, autism, cancer, allergies, cardiovascular protection, depression, aging, Alzheimer's disease, neurodegenerative diseases, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and wearable diagnostics.! !! !",S10,OD,OD,OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9708775,S10OD026962,S10OD026962-01,26962,,,2019,1,1161,Tom,,,,,,,,,
2130,Customizable web-based mentor training for STEM mentoring programs,"There is a national shortage of young people entering and remaining in STEM majors and careers. In addition, there are certain subgroups of youth particularly underrepresented in STEM including girls, youth with a disability, youth living in a low-income family, youth who are or will be first-generation college students, and youth from an ethnic or racial minority group. One promising strategy to excite, recruit, and retain youth in STEM is to offer them the opportunity to participate in a STEM mentoring program. Pre-match mentor training has been shown to support the development of close and longer-lasting mentoring relationships; however, no mentor training specific to issues relevant to STEM mentoring of youth exist. The main purpose of this project is to develop new mentor training lessons based on research associated with STEM recruitment that build upon previous successes in providing core, pre-match, web-based mentor training. In addition to tailoring mentor training to the needs of training mentors in skills related to STEM success, training directors of mentoring programs, more generally, have requested the ability to customize online training to meet the unique needs of their program, sometimes adding lessons and sometimes deleting those that may not be relevant to their program model or requirements. A second goal of this project is to enhance the flexibility of iRT's eTrove, a learning (LMS) and project management software platform, to allow diverse STEM mentoring programs to create custom training for their volunteer mentors. In Phase 1, two pre-match mentor training lessons will be created based upon the practice experience of the PI's, key informant interviews with STEM mentoring professionals, and a comprehensive literature review conducted by two of the investigators. In addition, custom course creation functionality will be programmed into the eTrove LMS and alpha tested. Once the lessons and LMS enhancements have been programmed and alpha tested, STEM mentoring program staff members (N = 5) will individually test the usability of the software in a One-to-One Evaluation Study. After any software errors or usability problems are addressed, a Feasibility Study testing both the training and the new software functionality will be conducted with staff from eight STEM mentoring programs and three mentors from each program. Pending reaching benchmark outcomes in Phase 1, Phase 2 will have the goal of creating six additional lessons related to successful STEM mentoring, increasing the flexibility in the LMS course customization functionality adding administrative features to the dashboard; enhancing individual and cross- mentor reporting features for match support staff members and evaluators.",R43,GM,NIGMS,GM,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10081508,R43GM137663,R43GM137663-01A1,137663,A1,,2020,1,1169,Audie,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2132,"Soft, Epidermal Biosystems with Advanced Sensing and Microfluidics Capabilities for Assessing Fatigability Biomarkers","Fatigue is a common, multifaceted symptom associated with the onset of functional decline in aging populations. Typically reported in absence of a specific cause, fatigue is of increasing clinical relevance because of its association with adverse health outcomes, onset of age-related disability (frailty), and premature mortality. As the geriatric population continues to grow in the US and worldwide, the ability to clinically assess and treat fatigue, as well as associated conditions (frailty) will become increasingly paramount. Fatigue has been shown to be a key clinical indicator of deterioration in quality of life for elderly populations; however, fatigue etiology is poorly understood because there is a lack of quantitative methods to assess fatigue, and its physiological and biochemical correlates are poorly understood. Clinicians primarily rely on self-reporting assessments from patients to evaluate fatigue and mobility (e.g. muscle fatigue). Such self- reporting strategies fail to capture the impact of fatigue on daily activities and quality of sleep. The resulting ambiguity limits therapeutic development and clinical interventions. The emerging concept of fatigability seeks to address this shortcoming by establishing a relationship between the experiential levels of fatigue to the intensity, duration, and/or frequency of physical activity, thereby enabling truly objective measures of fatigue. Although multiple approaches to measuring fatigability have been proposed, no standardized method or instrumentation currently exists. The present proposal addresses this unmet need with the design and development of a wearable, noninvasive, ""Tattoo-Inspired Bio-Integrated"" (TIBI) platform that measures both biochemical markers from eccrine sweat together with biophysical markers for the preclinical testing and characterization of fatigability in geriatric populations. The insights from this proposed work will enable assessment of the TIBI platform in free-living fatigability measurements, enabling a new diagnostic paradigm for the onset of functional decline in aging populations.",R43,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10009439,R43AG067835,R43AG067835-01,67835,,,2020,1,1171,Audie,,,,,,,,,
2140,Remote Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment Service for Alcohol (R-BIRT),"Significance: The USPHSTF, SAMHSA, CDC, and NIAAA have affirmed the importance of screening in medical settings for alcohol consumption that exceeds the NIAAA low risk limits, brief educational and motivational counseling for those who screen positive or have other evidence of an Alcohol Use Disorder, and, when appropriate, referral to treatment (SBIRT). However, translation to clinical practice continues to be elusive. Polaris Health Directions (Small Business) and the University of Massachusetts Medical School (Research Institute) have partnered to solve this problem by creating the Remote Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment service for alcohol (R-BIRT), a telehealth service for delivering evidence based alcohol brief interventions and referral to treatment during a medical encounter in a cost-effective, sustainable way. Investigators: We have extensive expertise in SBIRT for alcohol (Boudreaux, Bernstein); telehealth (Boudreaux); development, testing, and marketing of behavioral intervention technologies (Boudreaux, Harralson; Grissom); comparative effectiveness trial design and analysis (Barton); and health economics (Sachs). Combined, the team has over 100 publications related to SBIRT and constituent technology domains. Innovation: This Phase II STTR will pioneer telehealth delivery of SBIRT for alcohol. It will be flexible enough for a variety of medical settings, and will develop and expand software capable of facilitating both telehealth and in-person SBIRT delivery models. It will further innovate SBIRT research and clinical practice by exploring mechanisms of action, an objective rarely incorporated into SBIRT studies. Approach: The design is a two arm, single blind (outcomes assessor), randomized, non-inferiority trial. Emergency department (ED) patients (n=356) who drink above the NIAAA low risk limits or have evidence of an Alcohol Use Disorder will be randomized to the telehealth model (R-BIRT) or a gold-standard in-person intervention (SBIRT) and followed for 6 months post-visit using a multi-method outcomes attainment plan. The study will establish the non-inferiority of the telehealth model compared to the in-person model in reducing alcohol use and alcohol related consequences, while showing that the telehealth model is the more cost effective of the two. Mechanisms of action, including patient knowledge of low risk drinking limits, motivation, self-efficacy, substance abuse treatment initiation, and self-help program engagement, will be examined. Environment: With the success of the R-BIRT Phase I and other relevant projects, including previous large scale Phase II STTR clinical trials, Polaris and UMass have clearly established their capability of successfully carrying out this study, disseminating its results, and marketing the final product. Impact: Because alcohol misuse, abuse, and dependence carries an enormous burden in both human suffering and healthcare costs, a strategy that provides high quality, evidence based care in a manner that is more cost effective and easier than existing models has potential to exert a substantial impact on public health.",R42,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,8904195,R42AA022035,R42AA022035-03,22035,,,2015,3,1179,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
2154,NeuroMAP System for Clinical Research,"Motoneurons are the final neural circuits that link the brain with skeletal muscles to enable the body to move. Impairments in the ability to regulate movement currently affect over 50 million Americans suffering from various neurological or musculoskeletal conditions. Yet the deficits in motoneuron control that underlie many of these conditions are difficult to discern because current research tools used to measure motoneuron activity from skeletal muscles are limited to needle electromyography (EMG) recordings, which are invasive, yield the firings of just a few motoneurons, and are only applicable to highly constrained muscle contractions. Although recently developed surface EMG techniques present a noninvasive alternative, current systems provide only gross measures of muscle activation with little to no information about the underlying motoneuron firings that comprise the signal. Advanced assessment tools are therefore needed to provide clinical researchers with measurements of underlying deficits in motoneuron control to better understand, evaluate, and treat disabilities that limit motor function. Our recent Phase II SBIR prototype is poised to meet this need. We have developed a unique, non-invasive, post-processing system that accurately measures the firing behavior of individual motoneurons from body-worn sensors during gait, exercise and activities of daily living. Through this Phase IIB SBIR, we now propose to advance our complex laboratory-based prototype into a turn-key, real- time NeuroMAP™ system that meets versatility, usability and feasibility requirements for commercialization in the clinical research marketplace. We will integrate the existing multi-component system into a usable, wearable and mobile compatible system of wireless sensors with conformable skin-sensor interfaces to support use-cases across multiple muscles, movements, and clinical test procedures. The present post-processing software architecture will be redesigned with real-time algorithms, advanced user-interfaces and automated reporting of motoneuron measurements for intuitive, user-friendly operation. The usability and feasibility of our device will be tested among five leading clinical research partners across the fields of adult and pediatric neurology, physical therapy, sports rehabilitation and biomedical engineering. Through these efforts, and through strategic investments to support the regulatory strategy, manufacturing process and marketing plan from our industry partner, Delsys, Inc, we will deliver an impactful, usable and validated NeuroMAP™ system ready for production, marketing and sales within 1 year of completing this award. 1",R44,NS,NINDS,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,9558653,R44NS077526,R44NS077526-06,77526,,,2018,6,1194,Chris,,,,,,,,,
2178,Using epigenetic science to improve environmental health literacy,"NIEHS defines environmental health as ""the field of science that studies how the environment influences human health and disease"". The environment in this definition includes the natural environment, man-made chemicals and structures that often pollute the natural environment, and our social interactions and lifestyle choices. Because toxic environments are linked directly to human health and disease, a critical need exists to educate the American population on this relationship to allow us to make informed choices about the amount of risk we are willing to take. Stated differently, to improve public health we need to improve environmental health literacy (EHL), which is the goal of RFA-ES-19-005 (Innovative Approaches for Improving Environmental Health Literacy). The RFA requests collaborations between small businesses and environmental scientists ""to develop novel tools, activities, or materials to build EHL"". In response, Nzumbe Inc. (Portland, OR) has partnered with environmental and education scientists at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) (Portland, OR) and local undergraduate institutions to submit this proposal. We will use epigenetic science as an education bridge to improve EHL because the basics of this science are relatively easy to understand and the epigenome (the sum total of all epigenetic modifications) responds to environmental exposures in ways that can improve or worsen health. Two complementary specific aims are proposed for this Phase 1 application, which will focus on undergraduate education. The first is to create interactive and gamified software based on epigenetic science that undergraduate educators can use to teach students about environmental health. The prototype mobile app will allow students to create scenarios in which identical twins receive an unhealthy exposure in utero known to change epigenetic patterns and suspected to cause disease later in life. The students will then choose different combinations of diet, exercise, and lifestyle choices for each twin that are also known to change epigenetic patterns to attempt to counter over a virtual lifetime the negative early life exposure. The students will be scored based on their choices with the ability to compare results with classmates and students at other institutions. The second Aim will create a prototype laboratory kit focused on epigenetic science that will provide fundamental information about environmental epigenetics. The kit will use a simple epigenetic model system, the fungus Neurospora crassa. We will engineer a Neurospora strain with a reporter gene that is epigenetically silenced by DNA methylation and sensitive to activation. Students will choose different exposures and then measure activation and DNA methylation of the reporter gene. Results will be reported to an accompanying software application module where students can compare their results with classmates and other schools to identify exposures with epigenetic activity. Successful completion of the proposed work will lead to Phase II funding to complete these modules and modify and extend them to public school students and the interactive software to the lay public and public health professionals.",R43,ES,NIEHS,ES,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9912055,R43ES031414,R43ES031414-01,31414,,,2020,1,1218,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
2184,SMILE,"Sexual and gender minorities (SGMs) have been documented in every region of the world. In spite of reported abuse, discrimination and stigma, little is known about their mental health (MH). Even less is known about the development of appropriate MH treatment interventions. Evidence-based treatments (EBTs) addressing poor MH are being implemented in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) using appropriate, affordable and sustainable delivery modalities (e.g. lay providers, mHealth). These advances create opportunities to provide MH care to SGMs not previously possible. To develop and implement EBTs, longitudinal research is necessary to inform us of the unique MH needs, determinants and treatment preferences of this understudied population. Pilot data for this study suggest that: SGMs can be identified and recruited in LMICs across SGM groups; prevalence of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and posttraumatic stress disorder among SGMs is extremely high; and there are variations in MH symptomatology and determinants by SGM group and country. There is an urgent need for longitudinal cohort studies that include SGMs from heterogeneous LMICs to understand the influence of culture and context on MH needs, predictors and EBT preferences, and to develop locally sustainable EBTs and methods for generalizability. Inclusion of methods (i.e. Discrete Choice Experiments) that identify optimal EBT approaches specific to SGM groups, culture and context will accelerate the translation of observational research to EBT implementation and provide a model that can be used to identify appropriate EBTs for SGMs in other diverse contexts and low resource settings. The SGM Mental Health in LMICs (SMILE) study represents paradigm-shifting research by defining SGMs based on gender identity and attraction -inherent biological characteristics- rather than sexual behavior. SMILE study aims are:  Aim 1: Estimate prevalence of anxiety, depression, PTSD, suicidal ideation and substance abuse symptomatology among 7 SGM groups in 3 culturally diverse LMICs (Brazil, Kenya, Vietnam)  Aim 2: Identify cultural, contextual, interpersonal and individual determinants of MH over time, by and across SGM group and country.  Aim 3: Determine SGMs' MH intervention preferences through Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs). To accomplish these aims we will use a two-pronged recruitment strategy that includes respondent-driven sampling and a mass media campaign to develop a cohort of 10,500 SGM (500 participants from 7 SGM groups in 3 countries). Study participants will complete online surveys at baseline, 12- and 24-months to assess MH symptomology, determinants, and treatment preferences. DCEs will be developed and included in the 24-month survey to elicit preferences for EBTs that are SGM group, culture and context specific.

2185,The MobileToolbox for Monitoring Cognitive Function,"The prevalence of dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's Disease Related Disorders (ADRD) increases with advancing age. However, the ability to disambiguate cognitive decline due to typical aging from the earliest stages of AD and ADRD is challenging. In part, we are hampered by a lack of sensitive assessment tools across the adult lifespan that can be easily and widely deployed within diverse research settings and populations. We will address this limitation by developing, validating, norming, and disseminating a MobileToolbox of cognitive assessments that can be administered remotely via a smartphone in adults aged 20 to 85. We will accomplish this objective via the following aims: 1. Create the MobileToolbox Library of iOS and Android smart-phone based assessments. These will draw from our existing work with the NIH Toolbox, the International Cognitive Ability Resource (ICAR), ResearchKit, ResearchStack, the FaceName Test, and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). The library will be open source and available for integration of additional externally developed tests. 2. Develop and maintain the MobileToolbox Research Platform, a software platform to support clinical researchers, especially AD/ADRD investigators, and software developers in the dynamic, customizable integration of the Mobile Toolbox Library into research studies. This will be developed as an extension of the platform we built to support the 2015 launch of Apple's ResearchKit. The Platform will support researchers to contribute or select assessments, to manage study and assessment protocols, and to receive, store, aggregate, analyze and share (as appropriate) data collected using iOS and/or Android smartphone devices. 3. Conduct psychometric activities to validate, norm and assess the reliability of the MobileToolbox in both the general population and various AD/ADRD research samples to create general population reference norms. The cognitive assessments will be validated against gold standard measures in healthy adults ages 20-85. The measures will then be normed and 3-month, 12-month and 24-month change scores calculated in an age stratified (20-85), iOS vs Android, national sample matching the 2020 US Census (N=6,800) for gender, race, ethnicity, SES and level of education.

2188,Point-of-Delivery Prenatal Test Results through mHealth to Improve Birth Outcome,"Nigeria is one of the 22 countries identified by the WHO to account for 90% of pregnant women living with HIV. Despite expansions of HIV prevention programs in Nigeria, only 14% of pregnant women were tested for HIV; only 27% of HIV-infected pregnant women received WHO recommended antiretroviral (ARV) therapy; only 11% of HIV-exposed infants received ARV prophylaxis for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) and only 3.9% of exposed infants received appropriate testing within two months and an estimated 51,000 infants became infected with HIV in 2013. Risk of perinatal transmission is increased when a pregnant woman is co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection which remain endemic in Nigeria where liver cancer is now the most common cause of cancer death. Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are also at increased risk of HIV due to frequent blood transmission and an estimated 50-80% of these children die before their 5th birthday. Despite availability of simple inexpensive interventions such as penicillin prophylaxis, hepatitis B vaccine or antiretroviral prophylaxis, implementation remains inconsistent. In 2013, we demonstrated that the Healthy Beginning Initiative [HBI], a congregation-based intervention that uses prayer session to identify pregnant women early, baby shower to implement an integrated testing (HIV- plus hepatitis B and sickle cell genotype) and baby reception for follow up is acceptable and effective in increasing HIV testing among pregnant women. For this application, we will develop and test the feasibility, acceptability and usability of a web-based database and medical decision model that captures results for HIV, HBV and sickle cell genotype obtained during HBI participants; store data in a secure, web-based database; encrypt data on a ""smart card"" which is given to participants, and make these data available at the point-of- delivery using a cell-phone application to read the ""smart card"". Data on the web-based database can also be accessed directly using the cell phone application. Evidence exists that when clinician have maternal records available at the point of delivery, they are more likely to initiate antiretroviral prophylaxis for HIV-exposed infants, administer first dose of hepatitis B vaccine with 24 hours for infants born to women who have positive hepatitis B surface antigen and screen infants born to mothers with sickle cell trait to allow early identification and initiation of penicillin prophylaxis for infants who have sickle cel disease. The ultimate endpoint for the Phase III trial is reduction in mortality among children wit sickle cell disease and prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV and HBV infections.

2202,Motor Learning in a Customized Body-Machine Interface for Persons with Paralysis,"The goal of these studies is to enable persons paralyzed by spinal cord injury (SCI) to drive powered wheelchairs and interact with computers by acting through an interface that utilizes and adapts to their residual upper-body motor capabilities. This is called a ""body-machine interface"" because it maps the motions of the upper body -detected by wearable sensors- (arms and shoulders) to the space of device control signals in an optimal way. In this way, paralyzed persons who cannot operate a joystick controller because of lack of hand mobility can effectively use their whole upper body as virtual joystick device. An important characteristic of the proposed approach is that it incorporates an interactive learning process, in which the interface adapts to the subject's mobility and the subject learns to act through the interface. This study aims at developing and testing the customization of this interface to a group of SCI participants with tetraplegia, resulting from hig-level cervical injury. The proposed research is organized in three specific aims: (Aim 1) To develop new functional capabilities in persons with spinal cord injury by customizing a body- machine interface to their individual upper body mobility. After fitting the interface to the residal movements of each subject, participants will practice computer games aimed at training two classes of control actions: operating a virtual joystick and operating a virtual keyboard. This study will test the ability of the subjects to perform skilled maneuvers with a simulated wheelchair. (Aim 2.) To test the hypothesis that practicing the upper-body control of personalized interfaces results in significant physical and psychological benefits after spinal-cord injury. Rehabilitation of secondary complications is important in SCI. A study will evaluate and quantify the impact of the practicing functional upper-body motions on the mobility of the shoulder and arms by conventional clinical methods and by measuring the subjects' ability to generate coordinated upper body movements and to apply isometric forces. Other studies under this aim will evaluate the effects of operating the body-machine interface on musculoskeletal pain and on the mood and mental state of the participants. (Aim 3) To train spinal-cord injury survivors to skillfully operate a powered wheelchair using their enhanced upper body motor skills and customized interface parameters. The goal of this study is to transfer the skills learne in the virtual environment to the control of an actual powered wheelchair. After reaching stable performance in the simulated wheelchair, subjects will practice the control of the physical wheelchair via the same body-machine interface within safe a testing environment. If successful, this study will lead to effective operation of powered wheelchairs using a customized interface that adapts to the residual motor capability of its users.

LVADs are standard surgical therapy for advanced HF patients refractory to medical management. Despite extensive training and daily care, LVAD recipients still experience driveline infections (14-28%) at an annual cost of $20,000 and represents a clinically- significant adverse event and one of the primary causes of death. Transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETS) are being developed to eliminate the LVAD's driveline. Currently, TETS technology is limited by (1) low energy transfer efficiency, (2) power loss due to coil misalignment, (3) reduced data transmission rates with increasing depth of penetration, and (4) heating of tissue. Bionet Sonar's software-defined ultrasonic wide band (UsWB) proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly greater than RF waves and with greater reliability. Since increasing energy efficiency results in reduced energy storage requirements UsWB also enables reduction in size of implantable technologies. Bionet's UsWB TETS (UTET) system includes: (1) energy transfer portal with internal and external intelligent piezo array-surfaces, (2) implantable controller with energy storage capacity, (3) external controller with IoMT portal, and (4) wearable power supply. These elements will enable wireless LVAD operation over wide range of clinical conditions with real-time data acquisition and diagnostics. Proof-of-concept for Bionet's core technology was tested in vitro, demonstrating superior data transmission compared to RF (700kHz, 180kbit/s, 20cm tissue depth) and ultrasonic wireless recharging. In this Phase I study, feasibility of the fully-integrated wireless, UTET system for LVAD support will be demonstrated by completing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Design and fabricate fully-integrated UTET system and demonstrate feasibility with clinical- grade LVAD in an in vitro model that mimics clinically-relevant implantable tissue depths and geometries. Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate feasibility of the fully-integrated UTET system with clinical-grade LVAD in an acute bovine model (n=2) at flow rates of 1-5 L/min for up to 8 hours. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet's UTET system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care.",R43,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10007683,R43HL152767,R43HL152767-01,152767,,,2020,1,1248,Tom,,,,,,,,,
2212,Using agent-based modeling to compare strategies that can reduce rural-urban disparities in cardiovascular disease,"Rural-urban disparities in mortality attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD) have widened in the United States during the past several decades. The complex interplay of preventive health care delivery and community-level behavioral and contextual factors contribute to the differences in cardiovascular health between rural and urban residents. Recently, systems science and simulation modeling have played an important role in the evaluation, selection, and implementation of evidence-based interventions. However, existing models do not account for either the specific characteristics of populations living in rural communities, or the health care services and other contextual factors of these communities. We propose to use agent-based modeling -- a systems science approach that incorporates data from various sources and simulates real-world clinical or community settings -- to help disentangle these complexities, elucidate causal pathways, and identify potentially effective interventions in rural communities. Our long-term goal is to find effective clinical and public health solutions to reduce rural-urban disparities in cardiovascular health among rural communities in Georgia and New York. Taking an integrated preventive health care and community perspective, we will accomplish our specific aims using an agent-based model of community-based CVD prevention and test the effectiveness of the following interventions at the rural county level. First, we will estimate the health impact of improving health care delivery and access using home-based telemonitoring programs and expanding insurance coverage, focusing on three major CVD risk factors: hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol (Aim 1). Second, we will estimate the health impact of public health interventions, including improving the food environment, community-based health promotion, and increasing tobacco taxes for reducing four important lifestyle factors related with CVD: obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and smoking (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will use the CVD Policy Model, a well- validated US population-based CVD epidemiology simulation model and translate projected beneficial effects on the seven risk factors and lifestyles tested in Aim 1 and 2 into downstream impact on CVD events. This will allow us to assess the potential of these individual or combined interventions on rural-urban disparities in the incidence and mortality of CVD and direct medical costs at the state level. The proposed research is innovative because we develop a policy simulation model to inform decision-making for health care and public health management of CVD in rural counties, integrating clinical with community systems to find the most effective evidence-based intervention.",R01,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9716311,R01MD013886,R01MD013886-01,13886,,,2019,1,1254,Josh,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2231,Randomized Trial of Automated Video-Assisted Smoking Treatment for People Living with HIV,"Modern antiretroviral therapy has brought about significantly increased life expectancies for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). However, the effort to reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular disease and various malignancies in this population remains an important public health priority. Arguably, the most effective way to prevent these diseases in PLWH would be to reduce the prevalence of cigarette smoking. Despite the significant need, relatively few smoking cessation trials with PLWH appear in the literature. Thus, efforts to develop and evaluate sustainable, low cost evidence-based cessation interventions for smokers with HIV are needed. Given the widespread proliferation of mobile phones, the potential of using mHealth applications to improve the reach and efficacy of cessation interventions is promising, but evidence of efficacy is lacking, particularly among PLWH. With these needs in mind, the overarching purpose of the proposed project is to evaluate a fully automated smartphone intervention for HIV+ smokers. Participants (n=500) will be randomized to one of two treatment conditions: 1) Standard Treatment (ST, n=250) or Automated Video-Assisted Smoking Treatment (AVAST, n=250). ST participants will be electronically connected to state quitline- delivered cessation treatment, consisting of proactive phone counseling plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in the form of transdermal patches. This approach, frequently referred to as Ask Advise Connect (AAC), was developed by our team and has been successfully implemented in numerous health systems. ST will be compared to AVAST, a fully automated treatment delivery approach. In the AVAST condition, participants will receive NRT plus an interactive smartphone-based intervention that comprises individually tailored audio/video and text content. Foundational programming and developmental work for AVAST has already been completed by the Stephenson Cancer Center's mHealth Shared Resource, and results from a series of pilot studies (including extensive work conducted at both proposed HIV clinic recruitment sites) with beta versions of the mobile application and data management system are extremely encouraging. The major goal of this project is to determine if AVAST performs better, in terms of facilitating long-term smoking abstinence (i.e., biochemically verified abstinence 12 months post-enrollment), than the more resource-intensive ST approach. If efficacy is established, the AVAST approach will be readily adoptable by various HIV clinic and community-based organizations, and offer an efficient way to allocate limited public health resources to tobacco control interventions. The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of AVAST for facilitating smoking cessation among PLWH. Secondary aims include: 1) exploring potential mediators and moderators, and 2) conducting economic evaluations to assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of AVAST. In sum, there is a critical need for efficacious, cost-effective, and sustainable cessation treatments for PLWH who smoke tobacco. The proposed AVAST intervention has been designed to help fill this need.",R01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9841250,R01CA243552,R01CA243552-01,243552,,,2019,1,1275,Chris,,,,,,,,,
2245,IMPACT: Increased Monitoring of Physical Activity and Calories with Technology,"Since severe obesity in youth (BMI for age ≥120th percentile) has been steadily increasing, intensive clinical intervention is necessitated, which is often delivered in specialized pediatric obesity clinics. Since the home environment and parental behavioral modeling are two of the strongest predictors of child weight loss during behavioral weight loss interventions, a family-based treatment approach is warranted. This strategy has been moderately successful in our existing, evidence-based pediatric weight management program (Brenner FIT), but since programs such as Brenner FIT rely on face-to-face delivery of programmatic elements, the dose delivered is limited by the time constraints experienced by families enrolled in treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to refine and pilot a tailored, mobile (mHealth) component to augment an existing, evidence-based pediatric weight management program (Brenner FIT) to determine acceptability from a patient and clinical staff perspective, feasibility, and economic costs relative to the established weight management protocol alone [i.e., Brenner FIT vs. Brenner FIT + mHealth (Brenner mFIT)]. Primary Aim 1: Finalize an intervention for adolescent youth with obesity, consisting of podcasts/videos and electronic self-monitoring, to promote reduced caloric intake and increase physical activity. Primary Aim 2: Pilot the intervention in dyads (n = 40) recruited from a pediatric weight loss clinic, to establish acceptability and feasibility of the intervention relative to standard care (n = 40). Secondary Aim: To establish costs associated with development and implementation of mHealth components when delivered with the Brenner FIT program. Study design: For this project, we will randomize 80 youth with obesity (13 - 18yrs) and a caregiver (dyads) to the Brenner FIT condition or the Brenner mFIT condition. All participants will complete baseline measures prior to randomization, and at three and six months. All youth participants will receive a commercially available activity monitor. Caregivers will receive podcasts with a story about a caregiver supporting weight loss in a child by providing healthy foods/activities for his/her family, including healthy eating and physical activity information. Children will receive animated videos that contain healthy eating and physical activity messaging, with an engaging story of a child losing weight. All participants will have access to a website and mobile apps where they will track weight, diet, and physical activity for themselves (youth) or their child (parents). Based on their reports of weight, eating, and physical activity, the messaging received from clinical staff by the families will be individually tailored to promote healthy behaviors and overcome perceived barriers. The proposed research is innovative in that it explicitly incorporates theory into the intervention and evaluation components of the project and builds upon an existing literature on mHealth interventions that use mobile technology.",R34,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9816290,R34DK119815,R34DK119815-01A1,119815,A1,,2019,1,1291,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
2251,Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management - Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP),"In the US, children from minority ethnic and racial backgrounds suffer disproportionately from asthma. Despite well established guidelines, under-treatment for asthma is common, especially for poor and minority populations. Our prior work has demonstrated that school-based directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medications can improve outcomes for poor, urban children with persistent asthma. We have also found that school-based telemedicine can effectively facilitate assessments by primary care providers (PCPs) for preventive medication prescriptions for DOT and for follow-up care. However, to our concern we have found that children do not benefit equally from our programs. Specifically, among the subgroup of children with moderate to severe persistent or difficult to control asthma at baseline, the majority did not achieve control despite these school-based interventions. In fact, despite telemedicine follow-up assessments with PCP prompting for guideline-based step-ups in treatments, many of these children remained under-treated. We realize that our existing programs may be insufficient for these children, since they do not include specialist consultation for optimization of medication management or for identification and treatment of co-morbid conditions and triggers. Importantly, specialist care is substantially underutilized by poor and minority children who bear the greatest morbidity burden from asthma, leading to inconsistent delivery of guideline-based treatments and continued disparities. In response to PAR-15-279, we propose an innovative school-based program for urban children with moderate to severe persistent or difficult to control asthma. The Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management-Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP) program enhances our school-based, primary care directed asthma program with specialist-supported care to ensure optimal guideline-based treatment. We propose a randomized trial of TEAM-UP versus an enhanced care comparison group. We will prompt PCPs of all enrolled children (n=360, 4-12 years) to initiate school-based DOT of preventive asthma medication and will recommend referral to an asthma specialist. For children in TEAM-UP, the specialist visits will be facilitated via telemedicine at school. The initial telemedicine specialist visit will be scheduled after 4 weeks of DOT, in order to allow for accurate guideline-based assessments of medication and care needs once adherence with a daily controller medication is established. There will also be 2 telemedicine follow-up specialist visits to assess the child's response to treatment and make needed adjustments. We will capitalize on the existing community infrastructure by implementing both telemedicine and DOT in schools, and maintaining collaboration with the PCP. We will assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of TEAM-UP in reducing morbidity and improving guideline-based care (primary outcome: symptom-free days at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) versus enhanced care. At the study's completion, the program will be better defined as a sustainable means to improve care and reduce morbidity for high risk children with difficult to control asthma.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9582384,R01HL142691,R01HL142691-01,142691,,,2018,1,1297,Chris,,,,,,,,,
2253,Measuring and Understanding Light Sensitivity in Erythropoietic Protoporphyria,"Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is caused by pathogenic variants of the last enzyme of heme biosynthesis, which produces life-long, painful cutaneous sensitivity to light. In EPP, the light-sensitive molecule protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) accumulates in erythrocytes and secondarily in the plasma and the liver. In addition to photosensitivity, EPP can result in anemia, gallstones, and chronic liver disease, and 2-5% patients develop rapidly progressive cholestatic liver failure that is fatal without liver transplantation. The approval of new therapeutics in EPP has been greatly hindered by the lack of quantitative clinical trial endpoints. While the Food and Drug Administration recently approved one therapy that helps to prevent EPP-related photosensitivity, no disease-modifying therapy is available for EPP. The objective of this study is to develop methods to quantitatively measure light sensitivity in EPP and to understand the genetic basis for differences in light sensitivity among patients. Light sensitivity will be measured by the combination of light dosimetry, transcutaneous PPIX fluorometry, and daily text symptom surveys. The genetic basis for differences in light sensitivity among patients will be characterized by performing whole exome sequencing and a genotyping array in EPP patients possessing the same FECH genotype and large discordances in light sensitivity and/or PPIX level. First, polygenic risk scores that were developed in large datasets will be applied to the genetic data of this selected patient population. Next, disease-modifying coding variants will be identified in the exome sequences, followed by in vitro validation. This project could lead to (1) methods to predict and prevent photosensitivity in EPP thus improving quality of life, (2) quantitative endpoints for clinical trials facilitating the approval of new therapies, and (3) a better understanding of the modulators of light sensitivity in EPP, which could lead to novel therapeutics. This research will be performed by Dr. Amy Dickey, an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. She will receive first-rate training in statistics, epidemiology, clinical trial design, and genetic analysis. Furthermore, she will be exceptionally mentored by Dr. David Christiani, an expert in genetic and environmental epidemiology, and co-mentored by Dr. Mark Fleming, an expert in heme metabolism and rare disease genetic analysis.

2255,Bringing Health Home: Evaluation of a Residential-based Telehealth Care Coordination Intervention,"Individuals suffering from Serious Mental Illnesses (SMI) are at risk for serious adverse health and social outcomes compared to the general population due to a high prevalence of chronic physical health disorders such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and Type II Diabetes, along with consequences of mental distress such as suicide, substance abuse, and acute stress. Comorbidity of medical and mental health issues in this population often lead to higher medical costs and adverse health outcomes. While pharmacological treatments exist for these conditions, they have limited effectiveness in SMI populations because: (1) up to 60% of individuals with SMI do not take their psychiatric or somatic medications as prescribed, (2) individuals with SMI have poorer clinical outcomes and experience high rates of hospitalizations, and (3) individuals with SMI experience worse care. Challenges in the management of these complex chronic health and mental health conditions have led to the development of intensive community-based service delivery programs. However, as currently structured these intensive in-person interventions have only had limited impact optimizing service delivery, and consequently on adherence to treatment and health outcomes. While in-person clinical contact in select situations is important, telehealth may serve as an effective and nimble intervention to help meet the high need for clinical intervention for SMI populations and particularly those with geographically limited-service access. Although research exists regarding the efficacy of telehealth with SMI populations, most of the existing interventions with this population have been designed for institutional settings, not community settings, because of barriers to adoption of telehealth such as limited access to digital technology, technical support difficulties and cost of necessary technology. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for developing effective telemedicine and telemonitoring technologies to serve the unique needs of this vulnerable population in community settings. This project builds on a successful Phase I SBIR project and ongoing Phase II clinical trial of the Medherent medication management platform. This study will test an expanded set of telehealth care-coordination services that can be used to address the broad health needs of individuals diagnosed with SMI living in community settings and supported by community mental health agencies. We will recruit 300 individuals, including 200 individuals currently using the device and 100 new users of the device. The study will test the existing Medherent platform and a set of extended services. Our key outcomes include acute service use, receipt of preventive and other health screenings, health outcomes and costs of services.

2263,Video-based Intervention to Reduce Treatment and OUtcome Disparities in Adults Living with Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (VIRTUAL),"Hypertension is the most important risk factor for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and reduction in blood pressure (BP) after stroke is associated with reduced risk of stroke recurrence1-4. However, for the majority of stroke survivors (SS), hypertension remains poorly controlled early after an incident stroke.5-7 In the United States, Black and Hispanic SS are more likely to have poorly controlled risk factors after stroke compared to White SS, and Black and Hispanic SS have higher rates of stroke recurrence compared to White SS.5-11 Prior efforts to reduce racial disparities in BP control among SS have been uniformly unsuccessful.12 Multicomponent care models that include multidisciplinary approaches show promise for improving risk factor control after stroke.13, 14 Social determinants of health (SDOH) help to explain racial disparities in BP control and stroke recurrence, therefore multidisciplinary post-stroke care models that target SDOH may be key to decreasing disparities in BP control.5, 7, 15 Limited access to post-stroke outpatient care contributes to challenges in developing system-level interventions for post-stroke BP control. Telemedicine and telemonitoring may be ideal approaches for improving access to care in SS. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to rapid expansion of telemedicine for post-acute care in stroke survivors; however, its effectiveness is unproven. Based on preliminary data at our center, we propose a randomized trial testing an integrated multidisciplinary telehealth intervention, the Video-based Intervention to Reduce Treatment and OUtcome Disparities in Adults Living with Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (VIRTUAL), in SS recently discharged home after inpatient hospitalization for ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. The intervention will include post-discharge telehealth visits by a multidisciplinary team, social risk assessments to facilitate social risk-targeted and social risk-informed care, and home BP telemonitoring and management. The care team includes neurology providers (physician and nurse practitioner), a pharmacist, and a social worker. Standard care will include follow-up with a neurologist and primary care provider and pharmacist-assisted BP adjustment. We aim to assess 1) the impact of the intervention on BP control 6 months following stroke assessed with ambulatory BP monitoring; 2) the impact of the intervention on recurrent vascular events 1 year after stroke; 3) the impact of the intervention on health services access and utilization following stroke; 4) moderating effects of race / ethnicity on the impact of the intervention on BP control, vascular events, and health services utilization; 5) the relationship between additional measured SDOH and primary and secondary outcomes.",R01,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10290172,R01MD016465,R01MD016465-01,16465,,,2021,1,1309,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
2265,Early Communication in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and its Prediction of Autism,"Language difficulties have been reported in nearly 70% of people with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), but language development is poorly understood in this population. Further, 50% of individuals with TSC develop autism spectrum disorder (ASD); language deficits are also common in ASD. In a preliminary study, we found deficits in early vocal development in most infants with TSC regardless of the diagnosis of ASD. Thus, the goal of our current proposal is to examine potential predictors of language outcome and ASD severity in infants with TSC. In Aim 1, we will code audio-video recordings of infants from TACERN (Tuberous Sclerosis Autism Center of Excellence) for canonical babbling (a precursor to language) and volubility. We will compare canonical babbling and volubility to a non-vocal measure, shared attention, in predicting language outcome and ASD severity at 12 months as measured by the Early Social Communication Scales (ESCS). Aims 2-4 will entail a new longitudinal study of the trajectory of language development and predictors of language outcome and ASD severity. Language will be measured using LENA (Language ENvironment Analysis) recordings (Aim 2); a fast-mapping paradigm (Aim 3) and the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MCDI) (Aim 3). Shared attention will be measured using the ESCS (Aim 2). Each measure will generate potential predictors of outcome. We will examine how these measures predict language outcome as assessed by the Preschool Language Scale 5 (PLS-5) (Aims 2-3) and autism severity as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) at 36 months (Aim 4). Currently, despite the high risk of language difficulties and ASD in TSC, very little to no data are available about the origin and trajectory of language in TSC and how this might predict outcome.

2272,Adoption of mHealth among Latinos with Cardiometabolic Risk Factors,"Cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF) -a cluster of risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes is a significant public health concern in the US, positioning cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of death in the country. Latinos have higher incidence for CMRF compared to non- Hispanic whites. Due to a number of sociodemographic and cultural barriers such as lack of insurance, lack of transportation, or language discordance, Latinos with CMRF often have difficulty managing their health condition which often results in increased CHD, stroke, and heart failure. Evidence consistently shows that mobile health (mHealth), which includes SMS facilitated patient-provider communication, telephone counseling, smartphone applications, and medical peripheral devices to monitor and access health related information, is effective in improving CMRF. While there has been an increased penetration of mobile phones in Latinos, with a reported 87% cell phone ownership, there are limited mHealth interventions explored in Latinos who suffer the most from CMRF. In order to facilitate the implementation of mHealth in CMRF self-management and improve the health outcomes of the Latinos with CMRF, this study aims to examine the factors that influence the adoption of mHealth among Latinos with CMRF using a mixed methods design. A modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) reveals how health beliefs, attitudes and mHealth literacy-one's ability to understand and use mHealth-influence Latino's motivation to manage their CMRF by adopting mHealth. The proposed aims are as follows: 1) To examine the relationship among health beliefs (Perceived Health Risks and Health Consciousness), Perceived Usefulness, and levels of mHealth Adoption among Latinos with CMRF. 2) To examine the role of mHealth literacy in mHealth Adoption. 3) To explore the individual experiences of Latinos with CMRF in the United States to elicit barriers and facilitators of mHealth adoption. 4) To generate a comprehensive understanding of how cultural and social norms of Latinos with CMRF influence mHealth adoption, using an explanatory sequential design. An understanding of the Latino patients with CMRF in terms of their characteristics, perceptions and sociocultural norms and how they influence the Latino patients' adoption of mHealth can help inform the design of a patient- centered mHealth intervention and facilitate its implementation. The proposed study fits the strategic plan of the NINR as it supports research targeted at using innovative technologies to facilitate self- management of chronic diseases.

2282,Translating Molecular Diagnostics for Cervical Cancer Prevention into Practice,"Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer among women, yet it is an entirely preventable disease. While HPV vaccination holds the greatest promise for reducing the global burden of cervical cancer, measurable reductions will not be realized for at least another 20 years. The only option for reducing cervical cancer incidence in the near term is increased accessibility of effective screening programs in regions with the highest burden of disease. The overarching goal of the Iquitos Screen-and-Treat Implementation Study (ISaTIS) is to move a strong evidence base for the use of screen-and-treat screening strategies into sustainable cervical cancer prevention programs appropriate for the health care context in the Loreto region of Peru and other middle income countries. Pilot participatory action research with key community stakeholders identified two acceptable alternative screening strategies for implementation evaluation: (1) single visit VIA- based screen-and-treat approach and (2) HPV DNA-based screening using self- or clinician-collected samples and HPV E6 oncoprotein triage-to-treatment. We will use a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach, applying mixed methods, in an interrupted time series (ITS) design to develop, monitor, evaluate, and compare the two implementation strategies against current VIA-based standard of care screening. In Aim 1 we will conduct a community census in three communities in the Loreto region of Peru to establish cervical cancer screening registries and identify key members for working groups to facilitate our PAR approach. In Aim 2, we will use a series of focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and surveys to develop screening intervention monitoring and evaluation (M&E) criteria, objectives, methods, and instruments to be used in ongoing M&E of the implementation of each screening program using PAR processes. Our implementation strategies will be guided by the five domains outlined in the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR). In Aim 3 we will use the ITS design in a RE-AIM and CFIR-guided outcomes framework to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of each strategy. Qualitative and quantitative M&E methods iteratively executed in both pre- and post-implementation phases will be embedded into the overall ITS design, allowing real-time adaptation of the programs for broader sustainability. In Aim 4, we will synthesize our experience in a formal cost-effectiveness evaluation to allow policy makers to make comprehensive comparisons of each program relative to current standard of care and provide key data for future adoption in similar middle income countries.

2285,Development of the Total Exposure Monitoring Unit (TEMU) for Pediatric Asthma,"This research addresses the need to develop wearable and non-wearable sensors that can monitor environmental exposures relevant to asthma for the Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS) Program. We will develop and test a new sensor system called the Total Exposure Monitoring Unit (TEMU), which measures multiple air pollutants with the temporal and spatial resolution necessary to characterize relationships with asthma morbidity. Our research will build upon the existing Home Air In Agriculture (HAPI) intervention study aimed at reducing asthma morbidity in a cohort of asthmatic Hispanic children in Yakima Valley in Washington State by reducing household indoor air pollution using HEPA filtration. We propose to assess the feasibility of the TEMU in a representative subset of participants from HAPI. By leveraging the ongoing intervention, this study will compare detailed indoor and outdoor air pollution measurements from the new TEMU system to the air pollution exposure measures from traditional monitoring instruments, as well as detailed asthma morbidity measures from the HAPI study. The aims of our study are to (1) Develop and laboratory test the TEMU - an integrated asthma monitoring solution that consists of: a wearable device that quantifies CO, NO2, and particulate matter exposure in real-time and collects nanoparticle samples for location-specific speciation of particulate asthma triggers, including diesel, wood/cigarette smoke, and some biological particles; and a table-top, networked module that provides in-home analysis of the particles collected from the wearable device in addition to time-resolved monitoring of household concentrations of CO, NO2 and biologically relevant VOCs including formaldehyde, benzene and acrolein. (2) Deploy and evaluate the usability and performance of the TEMU in a cohort of 20 low-income Hispanic asthmatics recruited for an existing household HEPA filter intervention study. (3) Quantify differences between in-home and out-of-home exposures to traffic related particles, and wood/cigarette smoke among the subjects participating in this project. Determine the correlations between the TEMU's indoor exposure measures and those already collected in the HAPI study. (4) Assess the ability of the TEMU to monitor reductions in indoor air pollution, and relationship between both indoor and outdoor air pollution exposures and asthma improvements (daily self-reported asthma symptoms from text messages and a digital rescue inhaler, as well as the existing HAPI outcomes that include urinary biomarkers, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide, and pediatric Asthma Control Test) in the intervention study.

2298,Severity Predictors Integrating salivary Transcriptomics and proteomics with Multi neural network Intelligence in SARS-CoV2 infection in Children (SPITS MISC),"Children have been disproportionately less impacted by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) compared to adults. However, severe illnesses including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) and respiratory failure have occurred in a small proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly 80% of children with MIS-C are critically ill with a 2-4% mortality rate. Currently there are no modalities to characterize the spectrum of disease severity and predict which child with SARS-CoV-2 exposure will likely develop severe illness including MIS-C. Thus there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic modality to distinguish the varying phenotypes of disease and risk stratify disease. The epigenetic changes in microRNA (miRNA) profiles that occur due to an infection can impact disease severity by altering immune response and cytokine regulation which may be detected in body fluids including saliva. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes of children with SARS-CoV-2 by early identification and treatment of those at risk for severe illness. Our central hypothesis is that a model that integrates salivary biomarkers with social and clinical determinants of health will predict disease severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The central hypothesis will be pursued through phased four specific aims. The first two aims will be pursued during the R61 phase and include: 1) Define and compare the salivary molecular host response in children with varying phenotypes (severe and non severe) SARS-CoV-2 infections and 2) Develop and validate a sensitive and specific model to predict severe SARS-CoV-2 illness in children. During the R33 phase we will pursue the following two aims: 3) Develop a portable, rapid device that quantifies salivary miRNAs with comparable accuracy to predicate technology (qRT-PCR), and 4) Develop an artificial intelligence (AI) assisted cloud and mobile system for early recognition of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We will pursue the above aims using an innovative combination of salivaomics and bioinformatics, analytic techniques of AI and clinical informatics. The proposed research is significant because development of a sensitive model to risk stratify disease is expected to improve outcomes of children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection via early recognition and timely intervention. The proximate expected outcome of this proposal is better understanding of the epigenetic regulation of host immune response to the viral infection which we expect to lead to personalized therapy in the future. The results will have a positive impact immediately as it will lead to the creation of patient profiles based on individual risk factors which can enable early identification of severe disease and appropriate resource allocation during the pandemic.",R61,HD,NICHD,OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10273618,R61HD105610,R61HD105610-01,105610,,,2021,1,1344,Tom,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
2299,"Longterm Effect Of Genicular Nerve Ablation on Knee Pain, Gait and Joint Structure","Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) affects more than 10 million individuals in the United States and is a leading cause of disability and medical costs. However, there is now a critical shortage of treatment options for people with KOA because comorbidities that complicate treatment selection are highly prevalent in this population. Recent studies indicate that blockade of the genicular nerve may be efficacious for OA knee pain, with benefit of 3 months or more. This treatment could theoretically be very helpful in managing knee OA pain in selected patients. However, those studies were limited by methodologic issues (e.g. small size, short duration),most omitted objective outcome measures, and only two used a sham control. It is also unclear whether the widely-used 'prognostic' block has clinical utility. While all reported favorable safety, adverse event reporting was generally non-systematic and, in particular, did not evaluate for longer term structural consequences in the knee. The latter is of concern because of the well-known precedent of neuropathic arthritis. Therefore, there is a need to better understand the biomechanical implications of sensory nerve blockade around a knee and the short- and long-term effects on articular structures. Understanding these aspects will predicate development of a risk mitigation strategy while preserving the therapeutic benefit of RFA. The goal of this R34 is to complete logistical preparation for a one-year sham-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of RFA for KOA assessing PROs including average daily pain (primary), patient-acceptable symptom state, treatment failure; objective measurement of physical function, activity, proprioception, joint loading using gait analysis and mobile devices, and knee structure using MRI. The primary endpoint will be at 3-months, with secondary endpoints at 6, 9 and 12 months. Planning activities will include deciding between two compelling candidate designs, which allow testing of the value of the 'prognostic block': ""Efficacy And Effectiveness Too"" (EE2) versus Factorial design. Additional unique aspects will include analyses of biologically-relevant variables (sex, widespread pain, unilateral versus bilateral KOA). We will utilize stakeholder and scientific advisory committees to evaluate the relative merits and feasibility of the candidate RCT designs, plan the study interventions, define outcome measures and targets, and finalize sample size projections and analytic plan. We will write the consent materials, and obtain ethical and regulatory approval. We will construct electronic source documents and a data capture system (REDCap) with query and reporting functions. We will assemble the teams and collaborations necessary to administer the interventions, conduct trial activities, monitor data quality and safety, putting in place subcontracts where appropriate. We will finalize development of a mobile application for frequent collection of patient-centered outcomes in the context of daily life.

2310,Continuous wearable monitor for the detection and release of Freezing of Gait,"We propose to develop a practical system, designed for daily, in-community use, that detects the occurrence of freezing of gate (FOG) and triggers external cueing stimuli to unfreeze the user. Significance: Parkinson's disease (PD) affects more than one million Americans and its prevalence is expected to double by 2040[15]. Many symptoms of PD become resistant to pharmacological or neurosurgical treatments and therefore become dominant factors affecting quality of life. Among the most treatment-resistant motor symptoms is freezing of gait (FOG). This symptom affects more than 30% of all patients with PD and is characterized by episodic impairments in the ability to initiate gait and the spontaneous arrest of movement during stepping. Incidence of FOG increases with severity and duration of PD with 80% of severely affected patients reporting freezing. Clinicians have long recognized that one of the best methods to facilitate movement initiation in patients with FOG symptoms is to provide them with a sensory cue (e.g. visual, acoustic, or somatosensory). Recently studies have shown that self-triggered cues (e.g. via button press, as is done in most commercially available cueing systems), ineffective in improving gait initiation but that exogenously presented cues reduce the incidence of an inappropriate gait initiation sequences from 20% to less than 1% and increase the magnitude of force generation during stepping increases by an average of 45-71%. Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that through the novel combination of commercially available sensors and custom software, the proposed system will be able to identify FOG episodes in users and provide a sensory cue to facilitate movement thereby minimize the impact of FOG symptoms on quality of life. Specific Aims: The following aims are proposed: 1. Develop a prototype electronics and mechanical packaging in a comfortable / easy to use form factor appropriate for use by individuals with PD; 2. Perform in-lab testing of system performance and safety; 3. Design & implement FOG Detection Algorithms; 4. Evaluate the prototype system in-lab and in- community.",R43,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9409366,R43AG057263,R43AG057263-01,57263,,,2017,1,1357,Chris,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
2312,Intervention to Improve HCV Treatment Uptake and Adherence in HIV/HCV Coinfection,"There is an urgent need for interventions to increase hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment uptake among HIV/HCV-co-infected persons. End-stage liver disease is now a leading cause of death among HIV-positive persons, largely due to untreated chronic HCV infection, and rates of HCV treatment uptake remain low despite significant advances in the effectiveness of HCV treatment. This study will develop an intervention addressing patient-level barriers (Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills) to HCV treatment uptake in HIV-co-infected patients and test its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminay efficacy. Based on formative research, we have developed the ""Psychosocial Readiness Evaluation and Preparation for hepatitis C treatment (PREP-C)"". PREP-C is a structured web-based interview that provides an assessment of a client's psychosocial readiness to begin HCV treatment and identifies domains of functioning which require intervention to improve treatment readiness. PREP-C has been piloted in almost 100 patients and a telemedicine resource for health care providers was launched in 2012 (www.prepC.org). In this study, we will develop and test an integrated assessment-behavioral intervention to increase HCV treatment initiation among HIV-co-infected patients. Our specific aims are: (1) To formally adapt existing behavioral medicine interventions based on PREP-C assessment to target individual barriers (Information, Motivation, and Behavior Skills) to HCV treatment initiation in HIV/HCV-co-infected patients who are medically eligible for HCV treatment, pilot test and refine the tailored intervention in 15 HIV/HCV-co-infected patients, and finalize the intervention manual. (2) To conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial with 60 HIV/HCV-co-infected patients who are medically eligible for HCV treatment, comparing the nurse-delivered PREP-C intervention (n=30) with attention control (n=30) in order to evaluate patient acceptance, patient satisfaction, enrollment and retention, as well as preliminary efficacy (initiation of HCV treatment within 6 months of randomization and persistence and adherence to the first 12 weeks of treatment in those who do initiate treatment). We hypothesize that the PREP-C intervention will increase Motivation, Information, and Self-Efficacy leading to higher rates of HCV treatment initiation, persistence and adherence in the PREP-C intervention arm. Findings from this vanguard study will inform the design parameters of a larger, more rigorous evaluation in an R01 application, if results are promising. The PREP-C web-based assessment and intervention package is designed to be scalable and can be disseminated through the live PrepC.org web site. The proposed study is innovative in that it seeks to develop the first web-based intervention for health care providers t use to increase HCV treatment initiation in HIV/HCV-co-infected persons. The study can have a major public health impact by providing needed structured resources for health care providers to increase rates of HCV treatment initiation in HIV/HCV-co- infected persons, thereby reducing mortality due to end-stage liver disease.",R34,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8897449,R34MH099930,R34MH099930-03,99930,,,2015,3,1359,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
2335,IVR-Supported Interventions for Cancer Prevention in the Deep South,"Each year, more than 572,000 Americans die of cancer and approximately a third of these deaths are linked to physical inactivity, poor diet, and excess weight and thus can be prevented. While exact mechanisms have yet to be determined, physical activity (PA) may impact breast and colon cancer risk by promoting weight control or perhaps independently by altering biologic pathways related to such cancers (improving energy metabolism, reducing circulating concentrations of sex hormones and insulin). ACS guidelines emphasize the importance of > 150 min/week of moderate-intensity PA in reducing cancer risk. However, most of the U.S. is inactive, with particularly low PA levels found in the South. Low education and income levels in this largely rural area, along with cultural differences regarding PA and barriers (childcare, costs) reported by African Americans (largest racial minority group in U.S., most of whom live in the South and report high rates of inactivity) may limit access to PA information and/or contribute to related cancer disparities. Telehealth interventions can overcome such obstacles by not requiring frequent clinic visits, expensive technology, or literacy and thus may represent a promising approach to promoting PA in the Deep South and extending ongoing community health worker efforts by the Deep South Network for Cancer Control. Most telehealth interventions have relied on staff counseling, but such processes can be automated using an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system to enhance cost-effectiveness, reach, and potential disseminability. Given our team's past success using IVR systems for self monitoring of HIV risk behaviors and the paucity of research in this area on PA, we adapted the existing IVR system format for PA promotion and cancer risk reduction in the Deep South through extensive formative research (11 focus groups on PA barriers, intervention needs/preferences with Deep South Cancer Control community health advisors and community members from rural and urban AL counties) and now propose to test the resulting Home-based IVR-supported PA (HIP) intervention in a pilot RCT (N=60) with a waitlist control. Study goals are to document willingness to call IVR system, vet newly developed intervention modules addressing the PA barriers identified in focus groups, and beta-test Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) based tailoring algorithms in preparation for an R01-funded fully powered RCT to test the efficacy of the program and eventual dissemination through the Deep South Network for Cancer Control. PA (7-Day PAR, accelerometers), fitness (6MWT), and body weight and composition (% body fat, BIA) will be assessed at baseline and 3 months. Primary aims include assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the HIP intervention for cancer risk reducton in the Deep South. Secondary aims include exploring arm differences in changes in fitness, body weight/composition, and SCT variables from baseline to 3 months and assessing the relationship between min/week of >moderate intensity PA reported via IVR system vs. accelerometers at 2 time points (7 days before baseline and 3 month assessment).",R03,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8833258,R03CA177538,R03CA177538-02,177538,,,2015,2,1382,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
2339,Mobile Health intervention for rural atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent, morbid condition. Anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic strokes is a foremost priority in AF but adherence is challenging for patients and lapses in anticoagulation are common. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a recognized program to enhance self-efficacy and improve adherence, quality of life, and patient-centered health outcomes. Rural patients with AF experience increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes due to geographic and social isolation, poor health care access, and limited health literacy. We propose an innovative, scalable CDSM intervention to improve anticoagulation adherence in rural patients with AF. This single-center parallel group randomized clinical trial employs an embodied conversational agent (ECA) delivered by smartphone. We have used the ECA - a computer character that simulates face-to-face conversation using voice, hand gesture and gaze cues to provide education, monitoring and problem-solving - to improve health behaviors and outcomes in individuals with limited computer and health literacy. Here, guided by a patient advisory committee, we propose to expand our successful 30-day ECA pilot to develop a novel CDSM program for AF. We combine the ECA with the AliveCor Kardia smartphone heart rate and rhythm monitor. We implement a 4-month CDSM curriculum and assess its sustainability at 8 and 12 months. Our trial randomizes 264 patients with AF who are receiving anticoagulation for stroke prevention to (1) the ECA/Kardia intervention, accompanied by provider alerts for prespecified results; or (2) the control, consisting of an AF educational session and a smartphone with a general health application (WebMD). Our trial leverages the clinical infrastructure of the University of Pittsburgh across western Pennsylvania by recruiting at 7 rural clinics that share a common electronic health record. Our aims are: (1) To assess the effect of the ECA/Kardia intervention on anticoagulant adherence, as determined by the medication possession ratio, electronic pill count, and self-report. (2) To identify the effect of the intervention on health care utilization accounting for costs of the intervention, hospitalizations, emergency visits, and AF- related procedures at 1-year follow up. (3) To determine the effect of the intervention on the patient-centered outcomes of quality of life and symptoms, as measured by the AF Effect on QualiTy of life (AFEQT) measure, specific to AF, and the general Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29 Profile at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months. (4) To examine mechanisms for the effect of the intervention by symptom burden, AF classification, health literacy and intervention use. We will additionally follow the cohort through the study period for exploratory analyses of rurality and outcomes associated with AF. Expected Results: In this project we will evaluate a scalable patient-centered intervention to improve anticoagulation adherence, health care utilization and patient-centered outcomes in vulnerable rural individuals with chronic AF. If proven successful, this intervention can be broadly disseminated to improve the care of patients with AF.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9816323,R01HL143010,R01HL143010-01A1,143010,A1,,2019,1,1386,Chris,,,,,,,,,
2357,Urological and Renal Disease Engaging Adolescents in Adherence Collaborative Trial,"The broad goal of this study is to improve treatment adherence for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with kidney transplant and spina bifida, two of the most burdensome kidney and urologic conditions. Nonadherent AYA with transplants are primed to spend more of their lifetime on dialysis, leading to tremendous loss in quality of life, increased co-morbidities and increased costs. Similarly, nonadherent AYA with spina bifida experience high rates of kidney damage, infections and hospitalizations. This project's specific aims are: 1) to determine, in a randomized clinical trial, the efficacy of a 6-month mobile health based intervention, using text messaging, tailored feedback and financial incentives to improve treatment adherence for AYA with kidney transplants and those with spina bifida and neurogenic bladder, 2) to test the sustainability of the intervention's effects and 3) to identify psychosocial correlates of behavior change. AYA with kidney transplant or spina bifida with neurogenic bladder across four large pediatric academic centers in the United States will be invited to participate. At enrollment, all participants will gain access to the well-established, NIH funded Way to Health web-based platform, an automated behavioral intervention delivery system. During a 3-month run-in, all participants will receive text reminders for medication taking or cathing. They will report their adherence to Way to Health by taking a photo of their medicines or catheter in hand at the time of performing their treatment. After run-in, they will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm 1 will continue to receive text reminders and be able to log in to Way to Health to review their adherence patterns and educational modules. They will receive $2/week to report their weekly adherence with photos, but remuneration is not contingent on any adherence goal. Arm 2 will receive text reminders, but will also receive positively-framed feedback on behavior directly to their phone, with a larger incentive of $10/week if they meet a weekly adherence goal. The primary outcome is improvement and consistency in adherence between run-in and end of intervention. We will also examine sustainability in adherence between the end of the 6-month intervention and a 6-month follow-up period in which Arm 2 financial incentives are tapered off. Lastly, we will examine changes in self-efficacy, perceived barriers and knowledge as mediators of behavior change, between run-in and end of intervention. By applying an intervention to support AYA with kidney transplants and spina bifida in their ability to comply with treatment regimens, we will help them manage their disease burdens and expand their opportunities for better quality and duration of life.

2360,Early detection and monitoring of Alzheimers Disease and Related Dementias using non-semantic linguistic and acoustic features of speech derived from hearing aids,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a serious national health concern that affected 5.8 million in 2020 and are expected to increase by 40% over the next decade. There is evidence that the functional, psychological, pathological, and physiological changes underlying ADRD may emerge many years prior to the clinical manifestation of cognitive symptoms, which is increasing the interest in early detection and monitoring to inform disease prediction and management at both the individual and population level. In addition, the higher rates of late-life depression and age-related hearing loss associated with ADRD complicate treatment over the long duration of the disease. Given the need for improved measures to understand and treat ADRD, several divisions of the National Institute of Aging have called for improved methodologies for prognosis, diagnosis and/or treatment monitoring of aging related cognitive decline that are more sensitive to early cognitive changes, less costly and noninvasive. Advances in digital health for hearing care, speech analysis and machine learning present tremendous opportunities to provide cost-effective, user-friendly cognitive measures that can be readily used, or adapted, for persons living in remote, urban, and peri-urban communities. The hearing aids (HAs) have the digital signal processing, computational and wireless communication capabilities needed for speech-analysis tasks. The unique ability of the HA for own voice detection facilitates the analysis of non-semantic paralinguistic acoustic features of speech indicative of early changes in cognitive health. The ability to extract non-semantic features of voice through the HA is a key aspect of maintaining privacy for the user outside of clinical or structured conversations, i.e. during the person's normal activities of daily living.",R41,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10600233,R41AG080977,R41AG080977-01,80977,,,2022,1,1407,Tom,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
2363,Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self-management skills (TABLETS),"Though rates of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) have declined the risk of CVD events increased among those with diabetes. Clinical trials have shown behavioral lifestyle interventions are effective at decreasing CVD risk and decreasing CVD-related deaths among those with diabetes. Face-to-face interventions are labor and cost intensive, but may not be more effective than alternative modes of delivery, especially where access and transportation are a significant problem. Studies have shown that telephone- delivered interventions are effective but, more importantly, that patients likely prefer health education via a technology modality. The telephone (either landline or cell phone) is highly accessible for low-income populations. Yet, there is little data on the effectiveness of CVD risk reduction interventions using a novel tablet-based approach among high-risk, low-income African Americans (AA) with diabetes. This study will determine the effectiveness of a multi-component, Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self- management (TABLETS) intervention on changing behavioral (chronic disease self-management) and clinical outcomes (CVD risk) given the needs of a low-income minority population with diabetes at high risk for CVD. We propose a pilot randomized clinical trial to examine the feasibility and efficacy of a theory-driven, multi- component TABLET intervention on improving behavioral outcomes (activity, diet, medication adherence, self-monitoring) and clinical outcomes in high-risk, low-income AAs with diabetes. The primary outcome is change in CVD risk behaviors at 6 months of follow-up and secondary outcomes are glycemic control (A1c), blood pressure, and lipids as well as quality of life. The proposed novel approach will maximize the effectiveness and impact of the intervention by implementing tablet-based videoconferencing as an enhancement of the intervention. This study targets a high-priority research area - disparate burden of type 2 diabetes, resulting from poor self- management. The long-term goal of this application is to test novel approaches to lifestyle behavior change that reduce CVD complications and mortality, and eliminate health disparities in high-risk, low-income AA adults with diabetes.",R03,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8927619,R03DK098489,R03DK098489-03,98489,,,2015,3,1410,Josh,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
2369,Implementing an evidence-based mHealth diet and activity intervention: Make Better Choices 2 for rural Appalachians,"We propose a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to test an adapted evidence-based intervention and explore critical implementation issues, including feasibility, acceptability, and costs, that influence scale-up and sustainment. We focus this adaptation, effectiveness, and implementation study on underserved rural residents, a population that maintains extremely high rates of suboptimal diet and sedentary behaviors, placing them at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and other chronic conditions. Within the vulnerable low socioeconomic status population of rural residents, Appalachian Kentuckians experience even worse health outcomes, including among the highest rates of morbidity and mortality in the nation. Such adversity is exacerbated by and associated with inadequate community resources. Increasingly, however, Appalachian residents and other vulnerable populations are gaining access to modalities that may be useful in addressing these health challenges, including internet connectivity and nearly ubiquitous cell phone use. Despite this accelerating technology use, the evidence base on personal technology-associated interventions (mHealth) in a rural, high need population remains sparse. We propose finalizing adaptation and testing an evidence-based multicomponent mHealth intervention, Make Better Choices 2 (MBC2), a behavioral program consisting of personalized health coaching, an app, accelerometer, and financial incentives. In a recent randomized controlled trial among urban adults, MBC2 produced large, sustained diet and physical activity improvements by leveraging effective behavior change techniques, including goal-setting, self-monitoring, accountability, and support. To prepare for the implementation of this successful intervention with a new population marked by extreme health inequities and sparse resources, our team has engaged in extensive foundational efforts based on the Dynamic Adaptation Process framework. These include: (1) completing focus groups and key informant interviews to assess the feasibility and acceptability for rural Appalachian residents to use the MBC2 program; (2) undertaking a comprehensive community inventory to reveal existing and needed resources; (3) engaging stakeholders in community and academic team meetings, including community forums and CAB meetings; and (4) identifying MBC2 programmatic and structural elements in need of adaptation. With this extensive preliminary activity, we now propose a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial in which we: (1) finalize adaptation by wireframe and usability testing MBC2 with local Appalachian residents; (2) conduct a RCT to test the effectiveness of the adapted MBC2 compared to an active control arm; and (3) explore implementation outcomes and contextual factors, with a focus on sustainment.

2386,Evaluation of mHealth strategies to optimize adherence and efficacy of PMTCT/ART,"In 2013, WHO recommended that all HIV-infected women receive ART for PMTCT (PMTCT-ART). This approach provides treatment benefits for mothers and preventive benefits for their infants and sexual partners, and implementation advantages. However, there are valid concerns about risks of this approach if maternal retention or adherence falters. PMTCT programs have demonstrated remarkable flexibility to incorporate new HIV-specific counseling, testing and educational messages in maternal child health (MCH) clinics. PMTCT programs now need to add adherence and retention support for all women initiating lifelong ART in settings where health care workers are already overburdened. mHealth messaging is an evidence- based intervention that is attractive for this purpose. mHealth strategies have been shown to significantly decrease treatment failure in adult ART adult treatment programs in Africa and may provide an inexpensive, feasible approach to enhance PMTCT-ART outcomes without burdening health care workers. Our overarching hypothesis is that investment in mHealth for retention and adherence in PMTCT-ART will provide cost-effective benefit in sustaining antiretroviral regimen efficacy and durability. We have collaborated with the UW Department of Computer Sciences and Kenyan cell-phone providers to develop both inexpensive automated personalized SMS messaging and an innovative two-way SMS messaging system, currently in use MCH clinics in Kenya. In qualitative research, women in Kenya have expressed a strong desire for mHealth support to provide additional education, counseling and reminders to supplement counseling by health workers. We hypothesize that mHealth strategies will improve PMTCT-ART maternal and infant outcomes. We also posit that both one-way and two-way SMS approaches will be cost-effective, and that two-way SMS may be superior to one-way SMS. We propose a 3-arm randomized trial comparing one-way SMS vs, two-way SMS vs. control (no SMS) among HIV-infected Kenyan mothers in Kenyan PMTCT-ART programs. In AIM 1 we will compare trial arms for impact on maternal retention, adherence, virologic failure and resistance and infant HIV or HIV-free survival. In AIM 2, we will determine correlates of maternal loss to follow-up and virologic failur and correlates of infant HIV in the overall and stratified by trial arm. In the two-way SMS arm, we will determine rate of SMS interactivity, impact of critical time-points, and characteristics of high and low 'interactors'. In AIM 3, we will determine cost-effectiveness of one-way and two-way SMS interventions. These data will contribute a potential scale-able strategy to improve PMTCT-ART as programs aspire to 'virtual elimination' of infant HIV.",R01,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8842162,R01HD080460,R01HD080460-02,80460,,,2015,2,1433,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
2388,Ambulatory Assist Lung for Children,"Acute and chronic lung diseases remain the most life threatening causes of death and hospitalization in the pediatric population. Cystic fibrosis (CF), pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis have been observed to be the most frequent causes of lung failure in pediatric patients. Mechanical ventilation (MV) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have been used to bridge sick kids to transplant. These procedures can lead to poor post-transplant outcomes by their very restrictive nature on mobility. This project will develop a compact respiratory assist device for pediatric patients, the Pittsburgh Pediatric Ambulatory Lung (P-PAL) to replace ECMO as a bridge to transplant or recovery in kids with acute and chronic lung failure. The P-PAL is a wearable and fully integrated blood pump and gas exchange module that will be designed for implantation of inflow cannula and outflow cannula/grafts in the right atrium and pulmonary artery, respectively. The P-PAL will be designed for longer-term respiratory support (1-3 months before cartridge change-out) at 70- 90% of normal metabolic oxygenation requirements, while pumping blood from 1 to 2.5 Liters/min. The specific aims of project are 1) To modify the design and operational parameters of the P-PAL to meet requirements for blood pumping, gas exchange, priming volume, and form factor, 2) To build P-PAL prototypes along the design development pathway for bench characterization studies of pumping performance, gas exchange, and hemolysis, 3) To improve the hemocompatibility of the P-PAL by exploiting novel polymeric zwitterionic coatings that we have already begun to develop for our adult wearable assist lung, and 4) To perform acute and chronic studies in healthy lambs to demonstrate the in-vivo performance and hemocompatibility of the PAAL device and to study its interaction with the cardiopulmonary system.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9218187,R01HL135482,R01HL135482-01,135482,,,2017,1,1435,Audie,,,,,,,,,

John Henryism is defined as a survival strategy developed among newly freed Black people, one that endorsed the values of hard work, self-reliance, and high effort coping - all attributes of successful chronic disease self-management. The goal of this research is to develop a culturally-grounded diabetes self-management intervention for adult Black men. Black men are identified as a priority group in need of targeted diabetes self-management interventions. T T with type 2 diabetes that utilizes social support and mobile technology to improve patient-centered outcomes. The primary outcome will be a 0.5% reduction in A1C levels following the intervention. Secondary outcomes will include reductions in diabetes complication risk factors of blood pressure, waist circumference, and cholesterol. Additional outcomes include medication adherence, blood glucose monitoring, and physical activity. The 10-week intervention is comprised of three components: (1) ten group-based social support meetings that will include the formation of two-man partnerships (""buddies""); (2) a remote-sensing health behavioral technology, the cloud-based Telcare glucometer to facilitate objective monitoring of health behavior; (3) development of gender-sensitive, culturally grounded text messages designed to motivate and remind participants to engage in recommended self- management behaviors. Year one is devoted to designing the group intervention and developing and testing the set of targeted text messages by drawing upon self-determination theory, the diabetes empowerment approach, and research on John Henryism. Given its broad recognition and endorsement among Black men, the story of John Henry and research on John Henryism holds tremendous promise as a conceptual foundation for engaging Black men in a health promotion program. Year two will test the 10-week intervention using a wait-listed control (the men will serve as their own control), repeated measures single arm design (three points in time) with 40 Black men. The study also includes a three-month post-intervention follow-up assessment. Pragmatically, we have chosen to focus on behavior that can be influenced by one-to-one partnerships and small groups. As this targeted research program develops, we will incorporate the influence of family systems and neighborhood contexts within which Black men operate. In summary, Black men with type 2 diabetes can benefit from applying the principles of self-determination, diabetes empowerment, and John Henryism to their own health challenges.

2415,Multi-modal cloud based system for detecting early signs of driver cognitive decline and/or high risk driving behaviors,"Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI), in collaboration with Michigan State University (MSU) and the University of Michigan (U-M), proposes to develop a novel technology that will non-intrusively monitor driver cognitive decline and/or high-risk driving behavior that is especially suited for seniors (aged >65). Contextual physiological biomarkers along with computer vision based drive quality measurements will be obtained through a cloud-based acquisition system. Real-time risk assessments that are measures of cognitive status will be performed on the cloud to provide comprehensive analysis on drive quality metrics for seniors with varying levels of cognitive impairment. Assessment of a driver's cognitive status requires the use of a complex monitoring platform that can be seamlessly installed into any automobile without interfering or adding complexity to driving. Therefore, our goal is to develop a cloud-based, multi-modal routine cognitive/drive assessment system that combines a Smart Steering Sleeve (S3), which monitors physiological biomarkers, along with a Computer Vision (CV) system that provides contextual insight for biomarker changes and monitors a driver's habits. The Cloud-based Computer Vision Smart Steering Sleeve (C-CVS3) sensor system will be capable of monitoring biomarkers such as heart rate, hand gripping force, and the presence of excessive sweat from the skin surface indicating stress levels affecting potential drive quality degradation, which are also factors expected to be associated with cognitive impairment during critical events. Dash cameras provide temporal context including reaction times to unexpected hazards in addition to driver's safety measures, such as staying within the lane, and maintaining distance to surrounding vehicles. The transmitted data to the cloud from both modalities will be used to derive cognitive/drive quality indices (QI) for driving risks that can be associated with increased stress levels, attention deficiency and/or cognitive decline in individuals. This modality will result in an add-on adaptive platform in automobiles that gauges cognitive status/decline providing value to the auto insurance industry, RMV, as well as to the caregivers of the cognitively impaired patient apart from the individual himself to identify a quantifiable parameter before giving up driving or to seek additional cognitive diagnosis. The basic functions of this comprehensive drive monitoring system will be evaluated in Phase I on a number of individuals in a driving simulator. The technology will be improved in Phase II and will be further tested during real-world driving scenarios.",R41,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10258737,R41AG073222,R41AG073222-01,73222,,,2021,1,1462,Pablo,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2421,Impact of a novel HIV peer navigationand overdose prevention intervention on engagement in the HIV prevention and treatment cascade.,"People who inject drugs (PWID) are at exceedingly high risk of HIV compared to the general population, yet pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programs that target them in the U.S. are scarce and accordingly PrEP uptake in this population remains low. In recent years, substance use services have been scaled up to address overdose among PWID, however, they remain an underutilized entry point into PrEP. Pivotal gains made in reducing HIV could be rapidly eroded by the expanding population of PWID attributed to the ongoing opioid epidemic, new HIV outbreaks among new injectors, and the emergent COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted key HIV prevention services including syringe services programs, treatment and condom distribution. The overarching aim of the RADAR (Rapid Alerts through Drug Analysis and Response) study is to design, implement and evaluate a mobile health van that provides on-site PrEP, peer navigation and co-located drug checking services (DCS). This study will expand the reach of PrEP services by offering a novel intervention designed to increase PrEP awareness and engagement. DCS enable PWID to understand the precise chemical contents of their drugs to inform safer drug practices and are critical in places where illicit fentanyl drives overdose mortality. The integration of peer navigation will help attend to the multiple, pressing needs of PWID and subsequently enhance their engagement in the PrEP continuum. Our specific aims are: (1) to develop a community-level, mobile, integrated PrEP intervention aimed to increase PWID engagement in the PrEP care continuum; (2) to implement the intervention through a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial and evaluate its impact on being on PrEP or having seen a PrEP provider in the last six months among PWID (N=600) over the course of 18 months; (2a) to measure the intervention's impact on HIV risk behaviors (e.g., syringe sharing, condomless sex); and (3) to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of the intervention in terms of HIV cases averted among PWID (N=600) over the course of 18 months. The intervention (on-site PrEP, peer navigation, SMS reminders, DCS and associated risk reduction counseling, standard-of-care services) will be compared to the standard-of-care only (HIV testing, PrEP referrals, fentanyl test strips, naloxone) condition. The proposal is directly responsive to PAR-18-915's aim to leverage implementation science to improve each step of the Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain (STTR) continuum for PWUD as well broader NIH priorities to reduce HIV incidence and develop, test, and implement strategies to improve HIV testing and entry into prevention and care. The study is innovative as it attends to multiple comorbidities, it is inclusive of the expertise of PWID in all components of the study and builds on our experience in delivering outreach services during COVID-19.",R01,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10271704,R01DA053184,R01DA053184-01A1,53184,A1,,2021,1,1468,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
2426,Miniature Passive Device for Locating Lost Dentures in Care Facilities,"For the 35 million Americans, primarily older adults, with no remaining natural teeth, and 178 million with at least one tooth missing, the use of removable dentures can have many benefits, including improved mastication, nutritional intake, speech, and appearance, as well as social interaction and emotional confidence. Conversely, misplacing or losing dentures can have significant detrimental effects, including reduced oral functional status, high replacement cost, emotional stress and frustration. Denture use is a complex learned skill and wearers are often unable to easily adapt to replacement dentures, especially if they have worn previous ones for many years or have disorders affecting neuromuscular function, such as dementia, stroke, or Parkinson's disease, among others. Caregivers in long term care facilities and hospitals commonly report episodes of lost dentures due to the high prevalence of patient disability and dependency on caregivers who may be unfamiliar with managing dental prostheses. When dentures are lost, often after being removed and placed on meal trays, in napkins or tissues, or in the laundry, caregivers and facilities are directly blamed for the loss by the patients and their families. While families may ultimately be financially responsible for replacing the dentures, these frequent scenarios create immense emotional frustration and potential conflict for all parties involved. Many tagging and location technologies for simple objects (e.g. keys) are now available, but frequently require power and recharging, which poses a risk for dentures inside a patient's mouth. Therefore, there exists an unmet need to support denture wearing adults, especially older adults, and their caregivers by providing a safe, passive, low cost, rapid and highly effective lost denture locating system to successfully locate and recover the prostheses. ASTER Labs, Inc. proposes to construct a novel, fully-embedded, miniature, and safe locating solution using an antenna that is tuned to respond to a specific frequency, fully passive, requires no power inside the denture itself, and is easily enclosed in the denture base substrate. The lost denture's antenna is located via a small handheld detector that is operated by the caregiver. The detector operates using low-frequency radio wave harmonic reflection and multiplication techniques. The handheld detector unit is accompanied by a user-friendly smartphone mobile application to guide and assist the caregiver in quickly and efficiently searching for and locating the lost denture. The goal is to increase success rates of locating lost dentures, while giving denture wearers, families, and staff at care facilities and hospitals the confidence and peace of mind that these important prostheses can be located if lost, thus minimizing the financial, physical, and emotional consequences of fabricating and adapting to new dental prostheses. The system design will adhere to multiple safety specifications and regulations to ensure patient health and well- being. By providing the denture-wearing population and caregivers a novel, technically advanced, and practical locating system, older adults can be assured of regular availability and use of their personal dentures.",R43,DE,NIDCR,DE,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9199376,R43DE026377,R43DE026377-01,26377,,,2016,1,1473,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
2433,"Role of Social, Behavioral, and Ecological Processes in Dating Violence","Dating aggression among youth involved with the juvenile justice system (JJS) is an area in great need of innovation. Not only because of the pernicious course of negative impacts on both adolescents and their partners, but also because of the intersection with issues ranging from custody to delinquency to trafficking. To date, knowledge in the field of violence prevention has been limited by reliance on traditional, self-report instruments that are not designed to capture risk factors for dating aggression with precision and in real-time. Furthermore, research has not caught up with the growing influence of online social networks (OSN) on relationship functioning. Thus, we will employ a novel combination of online social networking (OSN) data, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), computer-based, and interview methodologies to assess the phenomenology of dating aggression among JJS-involved youth. We will recruit a sample of 300 court-involved, non-incarcerated adolescents (ages 14-18) in current dating relationships from the Rhode Island Family Court. Adolescents will complete a baseline assessment and participate in laboratory tasks, followed by a four-week EMA protocol on their mobile devices. At 4-week follow-up, youth will return devices, permit download of OSN for the prior 4 weeks, as well as complete self-report assessments. Understanding the interplay of temporally linked daily assessments and conflictual interactions prior to and following dating aggression is crucial, both to document the phenomenology of these behaviors among JJS- involved youth and to lay the groundwork for future interventions that will be able to incorporate real-time user data with personalized feedback to offset the development of violent episodes in vivo. !",R01,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9738349,R01HD095932,R01HD095932-01A1,95932,A1,,2019,1,1480,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2454,Feasibility pilot in preparation for large pragmatic encouragement trial of Bright Light Therapy (BLT) for depression,"The most common treatments for depression are antidepressant medications (ADs) and psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, these treatments yield only moderate benefits under ideal circumstances. These effects are further eroded when real world patients initiate treatments at low rates and have poor adherence or early discontinuation. This represents a depression care gap that supports the development and promotion of other interventions. One of these alternative treatments, bright light therapy (BLT), has established efficacy for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and non-SAD depression, is relatively low cost, and has few adverse effects-but is often overlooked and has little presence in routine clinical care. This R34 application is in preparation for a subsequent large, pragmatic trial to examine the effectiveness of bright light therapy (BLT) for depression when delivered to real-world patients with little ""scaffolding"" typical of highly controlled efficacy trials. We will conduct a feasibility pilot with a sample of 90 patients selected with a new clinical diagnosis of unipolar depression or SAD, or a PHQ-9 score >= 10, recorded in the healthplan's electronic health record (EHR). Participants will be randomized to either: Arm 1: Treatment as Usual (TAU): A ""usual care services"" control group (e.g., ADs, psychotherapy; all TAU is permitted and will be recorded for all participants in all conditions); Arm 2: TAU + Minimal BLT Encouragement: TAU plus two minimal written communications (mailed letter, secure EHR message) promoting BLT as a promising treatment and outlining steps for patients to self-initiate; Arm 2 will not include any phone coaching or adherence promotion; or Arm 3: TAU + Enhanced BLT Encouragement + Adherence Promotion: TAU plus 2-4 brief calls to encourage BLT use, advise on purchase of a light box (LB), assist with obtaining insurance reimbursement, educate for correct LB use, and provide motivational interviewing (MI) as needed to promote adherence. The primary outcome is PHQ-9 self-reported depression symptoms; the primary test of BLT effectiveness is the contrast between Arms 2+3 vs. Arm 1. We will conduct exploratory analyses to prepare for a future fully-powered trial. We will examine other secondary outcomes including anxiety, disability, and mood seasonality, and other secondary contrasts; e.g., Arm 2 vs Arm 3. We will also examine moderation effects; variation of BLT effects in subgroups (e.g., those receiving vs. not receiving TAU antidepressants); and we will examine mechanisms of BLT and MI intervention effects via candidate mediators including normalized circadian rhythm, improved sleep, and increased physical activity (for BLT), and readiness for change (for MI). This pilot will yield feasibility products to assist with successful conduct of a subsequent full trial: estimates of recruitment success, participant retention, and adherence with BLT protocol; refinement of the adherence promotion protocol; and an estimate (with wide confidence intervals) of BLT effectiveness.",R34,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10192431,R34MH122550,R34MH122550-01A1,122550,A1,,2021,1,1502,Chris,,,,,,,,,
2490,MundoComm: ICT for Maternal Health in Costa Rica and Latin America,"The goal of the MundoComm initiative is to develop an innovative training program that enhances the ability of community-based teams in Latin America to use ICT for maternal health improvement. Evidence demonstrates the feasibility and potential of ICT to impact maternal health, which continues to be an intransigent problem for much of the world, including Latin America. Costa Rica is a regional hub for technology and health in Latin America and serves as the base for this initiative. This project directly emerges from a previously NIH Fogarty- funded ITMI project (InfoComm) that focused on building a generation of informatics-trained public health physicians in Costa Rica and two subsequent NIH-funded trials (one through Fogarty) in the Dominican Republic. This project links the two former Fogarty PIs at the University of Rochester Medical Center with their Fogarty trainees and other faculty from three medical schools (Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and US), one technology school (Costa Rica), and community organizations to foster cross-collaboration, technological innovation and expanded use of ICT to improve maternal health in the region. Specific aims include: 1) Developing a mentored training program for applied research teams from throughout Latin America to learn about ICT applications in maternal health; 2) Testing specific team ICT innovations in field settings to demonstrate feasibility and appropriateness for local context; 3) Creating a Collaboratory where stakeholders share developing material, comment on plans, and provide support for trainees in the innovation process; and 4) Stimulating development of a professional network of ICT, medical, public health professionals with students, faculty, researchers, and practitioners devoted to supporting ICT for Maternal Health in Latin America. MundoComm will train multidisciplinary teams of public health and community professionals in a mentored environment with core and technical faculty, through a combination of didactic, experiential, and distance-based methods. The mode of instruction is engaging, experiential, and team-oriented, leveraging communications modalities (e.g. social networking, crowd-sourcing) to create visibility and feedback mechanisms for community-led ICT prototypes feasibility testing. A summative-formative evaluation process coincides with the project to help describe and evaluate the training model and the ICT innovations that result from the trainees' efforts.

2503,Bridging Communication Gaps between Primary Care Providers and Adult Day Service Centers to Reduce Emergency Department Use and Hospitalizations among Persons with Dementia,"Community-dwelling persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) are more susceptible to avoidable emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations than individuals in institutional settings. Adult day service centers (ADCs) provide community-based care to a growing number of highly vulnerable adults with AD/ADRD. Daily assessment and serial observations by the ADC's interdisciplinary staff support early detection of adverse changes in health status in people with chronic conditions. However, when acute changes in users' health status occur, ADC staff who wish to provide timely notification to primary care providers (PCPs) in order to facilitate early intervention, frequently cannot do so effectively. As the number of persons with AD/ADRD is expected to triple by 2050 and most remain in the community, there is a critical need to strengthen communication of salient clinical information between ADCs and PCPs in order to reduce costly hospitalizations and ED visits. Mobile health (mhealth) interventions can improve healthcare communica- tion processes by eliminating barriers to real-time bidirectional information exchange across a variety of settings. Yet, we previously found that ADC staff relied on facsimile or voicemail message to communicate abnormal blood pressures or acute changes in users' behavior, resulting in a delayed or non-response from the PCP. This allowed minor health issues to escalate into medical emergencies. The objective of the proposed mixed-methods sequential explanatory study, guided by the ehealth Enhanced Chronic Care Model (eCCM), is to inform the development of a future low-cost mobile application that facilitates transdisciplinary communication between ADCs and PCPs around key risk factors for poor health outcomes in ADC users with AD/ADRD. The following are the specific aims: (1) Determine health and social risk factors that are associated with ED visits and hospi- talizations among ADC users living with AD/ADRD over a one-year period; (2) Explore barriers and facilitators of meaningful communication between ADC staff and PCPs around risk factors associated with ED visits and hospitalizations in persons with AD/ADRD; (3) Identify the key domains of a future mhealth intervention that supports communication between ADCs and PCPs surrounding risk factors associated with ED visits and hos- pitalizations in persons with AD/ADRD. In Aim 3, we anchor the findings from Aims 1 and 2 within an mhealth framework to conceptually to map key domains of a future mhealth intervention that will support productive com- munication between PCPs and ADCs around risk factors for ED visits and hospitalizations in persons with AD/ADRD. This study is significant because improved communication across community-based providers can support early clinical intervention, improve standards of care, and thwart costly adverse outcomes for a highly vulnerable subset of persons with AD/ADRD. This study is innovative because it combines large-scale data on the health and social needs of persons with AD/ADRD with the perspectives of their care providers to inform the development of urgently needed pragmatic mhealth solutions that integrate care across community settings.",R21,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10093706,R21AG069801,R21AG069801-01,69801,,,2020,1,1552,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2523,Reducing Sedentary Time Using an Innovative mHealth Intervention Among Total Knee Replacement Patients,"The number of individuals undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) each year continues to rise. While TKR is effective for improving pain and function, subsequent improvements in physical activity are not common. As a result, patients spend most of their day engaged in sedentary behavior, which may put them at higher risk of experiencing poor function and disability, as well as lower the overall success of the surgical treatment. Intervening on sedentary time, rather than physical activity, may be a more feasible first-step approach for modifying activity-related behaviors in this population. Therefore, the purpose of this innovative clinical trial is to use TKR as a teachable moment for implementing a sedentary reduction intervention. We propose to use a just-in-time mobile health (mHealth) intervention to reduce sedentary time among TKR patients. Patients (n=92) scheduled for TKR will be recruited to participate prior to surgery and then randomized at 4 weeks after surgery to either (1) NEAT!2 or (2) Control. NEAT!2 participants will use the NEAT!2 (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis version 2) smartphone app until 3 months after surgery. The NEAT!2 app is designed to provide a vibration and/or audible tone to interrupt prolonged bouts of sitting detected from the smartphone's internal accelerometer. Further, NEAT!2 has been adapted based on TKA patient input and program preference. NEAT!2 participants will receive biweekly coaching calls between 4 and 12 weeks after surgery. Control participants will receive an education control app and receive non-intervention calls to assess general recovery. Both groups will receive monthly maintenance calls between 3 and 6 months. Data collection will occur pre-operatively, as well as at the end of treatment (3 months after TKR) and the maintenance assessment (6 months after TKR). The primary aim is to examine the effects of the NEAT!2 intervention on sedentary time at end of treatment (3 months) and maintenance (6 months). Secondary aims include examining the effects of the NEAT!2 intervention on physical function, physical activity, and pain as well as examining the dose response relationship between adherence to NEAT!2 and changes in outcomes. The proposed study will examine the innovative approach of decreasing sedentary time prior to targeting physical activity in adults after TKR and determine if a remotely-delivered, mHealth sedentary reduction intervention can decrease sedentary time. The study is innovative for integrating a just-in-time technology-based approach to reduce sedentary time during a ""teachable moment"" for TKR patients. The results of this study will build on our previous and current work to improve health behaviors after TKA and help to identify potentially effective and scalable strategies to improve long-term physical activity behaviors and physical function in patients after TKR.",R21,AR,NIAMS,AR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9882630,R21AR074780,R21AR074780-01A1,74780,A1,,2020,1,1575,Chris,,,,,,,,,
2539,A novel app-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention for preventing postpartum depression,"The prevalence of depression is high after childbirth: rates of postpartum depression (PPD) are as high as 25% among women without prior PPD or depression but with personal or structural risk factors such as being low- income or a women of color, among others. As such, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening women for PPD. However, disparities in postpartum mental health care exist: <60% of women attend post-partum visits where PPD screening occurs, and barriers such as lack of transportation or childcare have been shown to not only reduce rates of postpartum visit attendance but to disproportionately affect low-income women or women of color. In addition, the risk of PPD extends beyond 60 days post-partum, when pregnancy-related federal health insurance often expires. Smartphone applications (apps) may increase equity in postpartum mental health by providing long-term access to mental health treatment to most women. Indeed, in the United States, 96% of those aged 18-29 own a smartphone, and medical apps have been shown to improve obstetric outcomes and increase access to mental health services. Though in-person, cognitive behavioral therapy given through the Mothers and Babies Program (MB) has been shown to reduce PPD by 53% among low-income women of color, the effect of app-provided group MB is unclear. The purpose of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to enable the candidate to develop a funded research program to optimize postpartum mental health care for low-income women of color via an innovative technology-based intervention that may decrease their rates of PPD. To achieve this goal, training and mentor- ship are proposed in three key areas: 1) Advanced training in mixed methods research, perinatal psychology, digital health, and biostatistics; 2) Mentorship from a multi-disciplinary team of established researchers; and 3) Protected time to perform patient-oriented research on the feasibility of utilizing app-provided MB as a study intervention for low-income women of color with risk factors for PPD. Two study phases are required. First, focus groups and interviews will optimize the study intervention, which contains MB and parenting education (PE). Those in the intervention group will access MB+PE while those in the control group will access PE to encourage app engagement with both study groups. This is because women in both groups will receive bimonthly Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales (EPDS) scores from birth to six months postpartum. The primary outcome of the proposed randomized trial is demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of app-based MB, defined via recruitment and app usage (feasibility), and scores on the System Usability Scale and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (acceptability). Secondary outcomes include EDPS scores. The proposed trial will provide critical insight into a subsequent R01-supported randomized trial designed to examine the effect of app-based MB on PPD among low-income, racially and ethnically diverse women.

2553,Einstein Aging Study,"The etiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is multifactorial and given the current lack of disease-modifying treatments, there is a growing need to better understand the roles of modifiable risk factors. The overarching goal of this Einstein Aging Study Program Project (EAS P01) renewal is to elucidate pathways linking behavioral, social/emotional and metabolic health, as well as environmental factors to cognitive decline prior to onset of ADRD. The EAS cohort is a diverse community-based sample from Bronx County, NY, and provides the opportunity to examine social factors related to racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive health. In the current funding period, we developed and applied ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods and aligned them with robust clinic-based measures of cognitive performance to identify early cognitive changes and modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline. We will expand upon this experience by utilizing mobile devices that capture the dynamic time-varying nature of risk factors and cognitive performance as participants engage in their usual daily activities. Our experience with ambulatory assessment paired with our expertise in conventional methods and strong statistical expertise are major strengths of the proposal. The robust conventional cognitive battery provides domain specific measures of cognitive status and decline, supports the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and facilitates comparison with other studies. We propose four thematically connected projects, to measure exposures in relation to the primary cognitive outcomes: cognitive performance, cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and blood-based AD biomarkers. Project 1 will assess combined effects of sleep health, physical activity and sedentary behavior. Project 2 will investigate the independent, and joint effects of social/emotional health, inflammation and markers of biological aging. Project 3 will measure person-specific exposure to air pollution to investigate the effects of particulate matter exposure. Project 4 utilize continuous glucose monitoring in Type 2 diabetics to examine effects of glucose regulation. The resources and expertise within these integrated projects, will be supported by six closely linked cores. These combined resources will enhance our ability to examine biological mechanisms that may underlie associations of exposures with cognitive outcomes including inflammation, vascular processes, markers of neurodegeneration. Information will inform future targeted interventions to prevent of delay ADRD onset.

2562,Enhancing Research for Inflammation and Cognitive Health in Perinatally Acquired HIV (ENRICH PHIV),"There are 2.1 million children 0-15 years of age living with HIV worldwide; the vast majority have perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV), reside in resource limited low-and-middle income countries (LMICs), and are surviving into adolescence and young adulthood. In Uganda, where the proposed study will take place, there are over 130,000 children under 15 years living with HIV, the vast majority with PHIV, and tens of thousands more living with PHIV over 15 years. Youth with PHIV must contend with the negative effects of life-long viral infection and chronic inflammation on their neurodevelopment, medical status, mental health, and, for many, the demands of lifelong ART adherence - placing them at risk for not achieving these important milestones. Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) is chief among these negative effects. NCI in PHIV youth most commonly affects the neurocognitive domains of working memory, executive function and processing speed. NCI can affect youth's ability to perform in and complete school, interact successfully with peers and adults, find employment, initiate and maintain long-term relationships, and function independently. NCI can also interfere with adherence to medication, which is critical in HIV, and increase poor decision-making and greater HIV transmission risk behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex). The first step in addressing NCI in PHIV youth is detecting and diagnosing it, but doing so in Thailand faces numerous challenges. Few neurocognitive tests exist for Ugandan youth with PHIV. The tests that do exist require highly trained personnel to administer and score, take several hours to administer, and many suffer from cultural biases because they were developed for and normed on youth in the US or Europe. Without accurate, clinically useful, and relatively brief NCI assessments that can be accurately administered by all levels of staff, researchers and clinicians will be severely limited in their capacity to assess youth with PHIV in Uganda, missing opportunities to study and detect NCI, as well as intervene. NeuroScreen is a brief, easy-to-use app for Android devices to assess for NCI that is designed to be administered by all levels of clinical staff. The app contains ten neurocognitive tests assessing processing speed, executive functions, working memory, verbal memory, and motor speed. It is standardized and highly automated, requires minimal training to administer, and does not require record-keeping or scoring. The proposed study will: (1) adapt NeuroScreen for Uganda and Luganda-speaking populations youth with PHIV and evaluated the adapted NeuroScreen's usability and acceptability among Ugandan youth with PHIV and clinical staff; (2) generate preliminary estimates of the adapted tests' validity indicators; (3) examine the adapted NeuroScreen's usability and acceptability among PHIV Thai youth and clinical staff; and (3) explore associations between NeuroScreen performance and markers of inflammation and immune activation.

2568,FOCUS: FUNCTIONAL OPTICAL IMAGING FEEDBACK-CONTROLLED CELLULAR-LEVEL ULTRASOUND STIMULATION,"Although neurotechnologies are rapidly advancing, we lack a noninvasive, cell-type specific, and spatiotemporally regulated neuromodulation tool, which would radically change neuroscience research and enable clinically noninvasive brain stimulation with high spatiotemporal precision. The objective of this study is to develop a noninvasive, cell-type specific, imaging feedback-controlled neuromodulation tool that we call Functional Optical Imaging Feedback-Controlled Cellular-Level Ultrasound Stimulation (FOCUS). FOCUS uses a tripartite methodology: starting with ultrasound-mediated gene delivery to noninvasively deliver a viral vector encoding an ultrasound-sensitive ion channel to specific neuronal cells, followed by ultrasound stimulation to noninvasively activate the ion channel and modulate the brain activity, followed by online feedback control of the ultrasound stimulation parameters based on optical imaging of brain activity. Guided by strong preliminary data, the objective will be accomplish by pursuing four specifics aims: (1) Evaluate and select mechanosensitive ion channels suitable for activating neurons by ultrasound; (2) Optimize ultrasound gene delivery to achieve noninvasive, localized, efficient delivery of AAVs; (3) Develop and optimize FOCUS for noninvasive causal manipulation of brain activity; and (4) Demonstrate FOCUS in controlling animal behavior in awake mice by manipulating brain circuits. The proposed FOCUS tool is innovative and transformative because it addresses key limitations of current state-of-the-art neuromodulation tools, and opens new horizons in neuroscience and neuroengineering. FOCUS offers the following innovative features: truly noninvasive, easily scalable to large animals, cell-type specific, and neuroimaging-feedback control. The proposed research is significant because it directly addresses the central goal of RFA-MH-17-240 by providing the neuroscience community with a long awaited tool that is transformative and has the potential to become the next frontier in neuromodulation.",R01,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9583521,R01MH116981,R01MH116981-01,116981,,,2018,1,1622,Chris,,,,,,,,,
2570,Cornell Roybal Center Aging ePainCare Consensus Conference,"We aim to create a multidisciplinary community of investigators focused on how pervasive mobile technology can be used by older adults to manage the challenges of chronic pain. Mobile sensor technologies are fast becoming ubiquitous. Researchers have begun to document broad implications for health in terms of access to and use of various electronic-and mobile-technologies. Tools such as smartphones, tablets, eyewear, and smartclothing with integrated sensors have the potential to transform the management of various chronic illnesses. Evaluating the role of these technologies to address the problem of chronic pain, with a particular focus on older populations, is highly appropriate at this time. Mobile applications and text messages can be used to deliver nutrition information and behavior change interventions to older adults. Research also demonstrates that older adults with chronic pain and their healthcare providers are very interested in trying mobile devices to help them reduce pain and improve outcomes in multiple domains. To date, the reach and impact of these new technologies has been limited in the area of pain care. These data reflect broadly the promise of the new technologies and suggest progress is possible for designing, implementing, and evaluating devices that can improve the management of later life pain and have wide reach. The applicant investigators have formed an international collaboration, entitled the Cornell International ePainCare Collaboration, with the mission of expanding existing and facilitating new programs of basic and applied research to evaluate the role of electronic-and mobile-technologies in later life pain and pain care, hereafter referred to as ePainCare. We propose the following three activities to accomplish our goal: 1) Convene a conference with broad multidisciplinary stakeholder representation (i.e., behavioral/social scientists, health care practitioners, individuals ages 65 years and above living with pain, professionals working in policy- related roles and technology stakeholders) to review existing knowledge gaps and establish a research agenda using a method developed and validated by organizing committee members; 2) Disseminate a peer-reviewed publication that summarizes the knowledge gaps and corresponding research agenda established by conference attendees; and 3) Develop and maintain an online network to support collaboration among individuals and groups interested in conducting research in this area.",R13,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9125996,R13AG053044,R13AG053044-01,53044,,,2016,1,1624,Josh,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2574,Assessing the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on disparities in cancer screening and follow-up,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to dramatic reductions in cancer screening and follow-up services. During the early months of the pandemic, national organizations recommended postponing all routine cancer screening, resulting in dramatic reductions in adult primary care and specialty care visits; current rates remain far below pre-pandemic levels. Modeling suggests that these reductions will result in over 57,000 missed cancer diagnoses and 10,000 excess deaths over the next decade. However, these models are largely informed by data sources made up predominantly of insured patients and lacking race/ethnicity information. Thus, more information is needed to understand the strategies and resources need to support the recovery of health systems and communities that have been most impacted by COVID-19. The effects of the pandemic on cancer screening uptake may be particularly profound for patients served by resource-limited federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), which deliver services a large share of patients with incomes below the federal poverty level and who are Latinx. Latinx populations already have some of the lowest rates of cancer screening and follow-up care in the United States and are likely to experience the largest reductions in care and slower return to normal following COVID-19. This is, in part, because their communities have been hit particularly hard by COVID-19 (e.g. high rates of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations and job loss) and they may fear returning for preventive care even when medical authorities have deemed it safe. Our proposed mixed-methods study will estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rates of cancer screening and follow-up in patients served by a large, diverse FQHC (Aim 1), and estimate impacts on cancer outcomes (e.g. changes in life years gained, cancers prevented, and late-stage cancer incidence) in the FQHC population building on models developed by the CRC-SPN Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (Aim 2). Finally, we will gather qualitative data from clinic staff and patients to identify opportunities to improve post-pandemic cancer preventive care delivery for adults served by FQHCs (Aim 3). There is a critical need to understand the long-term impacts of COVID-19-care reductions on vulnerable populations and identify opportunities to meet the ongoing cancer prevention needs of patients served by FQHCs. We will collaborate with national stakeholders to develop FQHC-specific guidance to inform future interventions to support recovery from COVID-like care disruptions Thus, our findings will support access to care and reduction of health disparities for communities most impacted by COVID-19.",R01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10318023,R01CA265020,R01CA265020-01,265020,,,2021,1,1628,Chris,,,,,,,,,
2583,Disruptions in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Transfer Networks and Cardiovascular Health of Rural Americans,"Rural Americans face disproportionate cardiovascular disease burden, yet they must travel farther to reach hospitals that can provide effective, guideline-concordant treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Transfer networks play a crucial role in care for rural ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), the most severe form of AMI, moving patients from rural hospitals to hospitals that can perform primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), the preferred treatment for STEMI. Of the 925 hospitals have closed or been acquired in rural areas since 2007, 75% may have been part of a STEMI transfer network. Although closures and acquisitions of hospitals may disrupt STEMI transfer network, the impact on STEMI patients has not been explored. Existing research on hospital closures finds conflicting results on AMI mortality. Failure to account for networks disadvantages previous research in 3 ways. 1) Time to PCI depends on the geographic location and the transfer relationships of hospitals within STEMI transfer networks. 2) Disruptions can cause spillover effects to patients not directly affected by closures and acquisitions but in the same transfer network. 3) The characteristics of network affect time to PCI after disruption. Although not previously explored, disruptions in rural STEMI networks could worsen rural-urban disparities in AMI mortality rates and reverse reductions in rural cardiovascular mortality over the past four decades. This project will draw upon novel data resources collected by the research team including validated data on hospital closure status and timing and validated data on hospital-level PCI capabilities. Leveraging the expertise of the research team in innovative network analysis techniques, invasive cardiology, emergency medicine, rural health, Medicare claims data, and biostatistics we will estimate STEMI transfer networks using Medicare claims data from 2007-2021 and link networks to hospital closure and acquisition data collected and validated by the research team. We will leverage connections to stakeholders in STEMI systems of care and rural health as well as expertise in survey design and implementation to develop a survey of EMS agencies to collect information on the emergency medical services involvement in STEMI networks. We propose the following aims: 1) estimate the association of STEMI network disruption with through0network time to PCI; 2) estimate the association of STEMI network disruption with STEMI treatment and mortality; 3) identify network-level factors associated with changes in patient mortality after STEMI network disruption; and 4) quantify the role of STEMI transfer network disruption in rural-urban STEMI disparities. We will disseminate information on STEMI networks and their characteristics via a web-based app. Our findings will identify a previously unknown access barrier for rural patients and can inform policymakers and clinicians about how to improve the health of rural STEMI patients.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10210820,R01HL153179,R01HL153179-01A1,153179,A1,,2021,1,1637,Chris,,,,,,,,,
2586,Meeting women where they are: Multilevel intervention addressing racial disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality,"Severe maternal morbidity and mortality in the U.S. disproportionately affect African-American (AA) women. Inequities occur at many levels, including community, provider/practice, and health system levels. This proposal will test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multilevel intervention to address AA maternal morbidity and mortality in two Michigan counties: Genesee County (which includes Flint) and Kent County (which includes Grand Rapids). Interventions were developed or co-developed by our partners in these counties, who include AA women residents, enhanced prenatal and postnatal care (EPC) staff (including race-matched community health workers), and physician/health system staff and providers. Community level intervention. We will expand access to EPC services (i.e., home visiting programs, Healthy Start programs) using telehealth and flexible scheduling. Despite being designed for minority women, about 60% of eligible AA women in Michigan do not enroll in EPC services. Pilot work indicates that 50% of minority women who declined EPC services would participate if a telehealth option was available. We will provide this option. Provider/practice level intervention. We will address provider and health system implicit and explicit bias and corresponding structures and practices and make this learning actionable using daylong experiential trainings. Training will include didactics, reflection, discussion, windshield tours, and brainstorming ways to tailor participants' practices and settings to better meet the needs of perinatal AA women. Training will include everyone from physicians to front desk staff. System level intervention. We will implement community care patient safety bundles targeting maternal health disparities throughout the intervention counties. We will test the effects of the multilevel intervention using a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference with propensity scores approach to compare pre (2016-2019) to post (2021-2024) changes in outcomes among Medicaid women in the two intervention counties with similar women in other Michigan counties. The sample will include all Medicaid insured women observed during pregnancy, at birth, and/or up to 1 year postpartum, who delivered in Michigan from 2016 - 2024 (approximately 540,000 births, including ~162,000 births to AA women). Measures will be taken from a pre-existing linked dataset that includes Medicaid claims, death records, birth records, and EPC program data. The specific aims are to: (1) Assess the effectiveness of the multilevel intervention on AA severe maternal morbidity and mortality; (2) Test improved service utilization and non-severe maternal morbidity as mechanisms of the effect of the multilevel intervention on severe maternal morbidity, and (3) Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the multilevel intervention. This project will be among the first to evaluate a multilevel intervention to reduce AA maternal morbidity and mortality at the population level.

2599,Exercise Evaluation and Recovery Therapy(EXERT),"Eden Medical, Inc. is pleased to submit this Phase 1 SBIR proposal to develop the Exercise Evaluation and Recovery Therapy (EXERT) system, a mobile health (mHealth) solution for assessing exercise impairment of adult peripheral vascular disease (PVD) patients and increasing their exercise capacity. Overtaxing during exercise could be highly dependent on muscle oxidative capacity and muscle deoxygenation. While this capacity could be improved by exercise intervention, it is essential to assess the capacity of the participant to avoid overtaxing and thus disengagement in continue exercise. The EXERT system affords a wearable Bluetooth enabled near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system to quantify skeletal muscle deoxygenation levels to assess muscle oxidative recovery between exercise sessions and avoid overtaxing participant during exercise. The EXERT will incorporate a recovery strategy to inform exercise trainer on capacity level of the patient and personalized exercise program to avoid overtaxing the patients and thus motivate them to engage in regular exercise to reverse the impairment.",R43,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9620979,R43AG060868,R43AG060868-01,60868,,,2018,1,1653,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
2600,Addressing the double jeopardy of stress and hypertension among African American female caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias,"No demographic group is more at risk for the double jeopardy of caregiving stress and hypertension than African American women caring for a family member with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Both situations lead to reduced quality of life and cardiovascular disease-a complication of uncontrolled hypertension.1 Maintaining the health of these caregivers is critical to support the well-being of the care recipients. Although some multi-component interventions have addressed ADRD caregiver's stress and quality of life, 2,3 gaps remain in targeting interventions to address the complexity of chronic caregiving stress and hypertension self-care in African American women. This pilot study builds on our earlier work which showed that stress, blood pressure knowledge, and complex diet information deficits all interfered with older African American women's hypertension self-care.4-7 Lifestyle changes (stress management, reducing sodium, eating fruits/vegetables, and physical activity) are effective in managing hypertension. Our Stage I pilot study is based on the scientific rationale that we can promote these lifestyle changes by addressing stress reactivity/stress resilience, the psychological and physiological response of the body to stress, as the underlying mechanism to facilitate behavioral change. In this way we can improve health outcomes (caregiver stress, quality of life, cardiovascular disease risk). A small-scale two-group randomized controlled (RCT) pilot study of 28 African American female caregivers, age 40 and older with hypertension, will be conducted. We will determine the feasibility and acceptability of Mindfulness in Motion (MIM) plus the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH).8 Participants will be randomized to either the MIM DASH7 intervention or the Alzheimer's Association Caregiver Training (attention control) in 8 weekly, 1-hour group sessions via telehealth (video and telephone access). After completion of the intervention, both groups will receive four bi-monthly follow-up calls over the 12 months. To our knowledge, this is the first study that a) systematically employs one of the Science of Behavioral Change key mechanisms underlying successful adoption of health behaviors-stress reactivity/stress resilience9 and b) focuses solely on African American female caregivers of people living with dementia. The aims are: a) determine the feasibility and acceptability of MIM DASH and Caregiver Training for African American female caregivers with hypertension; b) explore the impact of MIM DASH as compared to Caregiving Training on caregiver stress and quality of life; quality of life; and c) investigate the potential mediation effects of stress reactivity/stress resilience between MIM DASH or Caregiver Training and self-care behaviors. This pilot will make a substantive contribution to the science of behavior change by identifying basic mechanisms, in the adoption of healthy behaviors that can be used to implement self-care interventions to reduce health disparities in African Americans.

2607,C-CART: Culturally Centered Addictions Research Training,"Despite decades of research and advancement in health care, there are limited doctoral educational programs that specifically boost the research training for the workforce in the area of substance use (SU) and substance use disorders (SUDs), particularly with underserved American Indian (AI), Hispanic, and rural populations who face a number of health disparities.1-6 Racial and ethnic minorities and rural residents often have high rates of SU and SUDs and experience high rates of poor health outcomes and premature mortality due, in part, to difficulty accessing evidence-based comprehensive and culturally relevant care.7 Given the need to equip clinicians and researchers with research skills in SU and SUD interventions and outcomes in health and behavioral health care settings, our proposed research training program will prepare doctoral-level health professionals to conduct culturally-centered research to address SU and SUDs in practice settings. With a shift towards telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for culturally relevant training among health care professionals is more urgent now than ever. The overall goal of the proposed research and training program, Culturally Centered Addictions Research Training (C-CART), is to educate clinicians, providers, and doctoral students in health professions (occupational therapy [OT], physical therapy [PT], counseling, school, & clinical psychology) in research skills that include culturally-centered practices, related to SU and SUDs which can be applied in interprofessional practice and diverse settings. The Specific Aims of this project are: Aim 1: Develop and implement an interprofessional advanced graduate certificate in culturally-centered SU and SUD research for doctoral students in: a) clinical, counseling, and school psychology, b) OT, c) PT, and d) interdisciplinary health, as well as doctoral-trained, practicing clinicians in the community; Aim 2: Foster interprofessional and collaborative teamwork among Scholars from 5 doctoral programs and the students who are clinical care providers as they develop culturally-centered research projects focused on addressing and curtailing SU and SUDs among AI, Hispanic, and rural populations being served in health and behavioral health care settings; Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of the training program through formative and summative evaluation of learning outcomes, longitudinal tracking of Scholar careers, and documentation of collaborative research efforts and products developed by students, faculty, and mentors; and Aim 4: Disseminate research products through Scholar research presentations at an interprofessional conference, submission of peer-reviewed manuscripts related to program outcomes, completion of capstone research experiences that emerge from the program, and a website highlighting program achievements.",R25,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10238380,R25DA053805,R25DA053805-01,53805,,,2021,1,1661,Audie,,,,,,,,,
2633,Ecological Momentary Assessment of Behavioral and Psychosocial Predictors of Weight Loss Following Bariatric Surgery,"Bariatric surgery is a powerful tool for producing significant and durable weight loss. Yet, not all patients achieve initial weight loss success and many patients have weight regain as early as 1-2 years post-surgery. Suboptimal weight loss patterns not fully explained by surgical, demographic, and medical factors has led to greater emphasis on patient behaviors evidenced by clinical guidelines that focus on appropriate eating and physical activity. However, research to inform such guidelines typically has relied on imprecise measures or not been specific to bariatric surgery. There is also little understanding of mechanisms by which psychosocial factors influence outcomes. Thus, there is a need to: (a) measure behaviors and psychosocial factors thought to be related to surgical outcomes (particularly those emphasized in guidelines) using innovative strategies to maximize data quality, (b) determine which behaviors and psychosocial factors are related to outcomes, and (c) explore how psychosocial factors influence weight both directly and via influences on behavior. Our research team was the first to employ innovative mobile health (mHealth) technology within an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) framework to measure adherence to recommended behaviors at 6 months post-surgery. We propose to build on this work by using EMA to measure behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental factors over a much longer period to understand how they predict success and risk at key post-surgical weight loss phases-i.e. active weight loss (0-1 yrs), weight stabilization (1-2 yrs), and initial maintenance (2-3 yrs). An NIH-funded multi-sensor PiLR HEALTH platform will integrate objective sensor data measuring behaviors and the environments in which they are performed with self-report information collected via smartphone in real-time and in patients' natural environment. Participants (N=200) recruited from 2 ASMBS-designated centers of excellence will complete a 12-day EMA protocol pre-surgery and at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 months post-surgery to assess recommended behaviors [e.g., meal frequency, PA], psychosocial indicators with the most prior evidence of an association with surgical outcomes (e.g., mood/depression), and key environmental factors (e.g., type/quality of the food environment). Participants will also be weighed at the above time points and 36 months. Along with describing patterns in behaviors and their relation to weight loss, we will test causal models to understand how complex systems of behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental factors affect weight loss, and to identify optimal targets for intervention. This project has the potential to build a much more sophisticated and valid understanding of who is and is not successful after bariatric surgery and why. This new understanding will directly contribute to improved (i.e., specific, consistent, and validated) guidelines for recommended pre and postoperative behaviors, which could lead to improved surgical outcomes. The enhanced understanding will also inform behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental targets for intervention that are mostly likely to improve surgical outcomes.",R01,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9054274,R01DK108579,R01DK108579-01,108579,,,2015,1,1688,Josh,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
2639,Confocal and Autofluorescence Imaging of Macular Degeneration using a Low Cost Digital Imager,"The overall goal of the proposed SBIR Phase II research is to build and evaluate a low cost, multi-mode retinal camera used to detect and manage causes of macular impairment. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) remains the most common cause of permanent vision loss in the US and many industrialized countries. Treatments with portable lasers and injectable drugs can save sight, but early detection and careful monitoring is essential to help maintain visual acuity and avoid over-treating with injectables. Specialized imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and autofluorescence (AF) imaging, have been developed that provide better detection of key lesions than flood-illuminated color fundus photography, but is not available to all due to their high cost. This creates a scarcity of OCT and AF imaging equipment at primary care and non-specialty eye clinics, which forces many elderly patients to travel to tertiary centers to obtain monitoring and treatment. In this Phase II proposal, Aeon builds on a successful Phase I project by enhancing its novel Digital Light Ophthalmoscope (DLO) for the multimodal detection of lesions associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Specifically, we will incorporate a custom near infrared (NIR) illumination module to perform multiply scattered light imaging for the detection of disruptions in the RPE layer such as drusen (Aim 1). We will also develop and test a novel and cost-effective structured light imaging method to create en face depth sectioned images of the retina, generating coarse topographic measurements of retinal thickness and height that will be suitable for the detection of treatable exudation (Aim 2). The location of drusen and thickness of exudative regions will be evaluated in patients with AMD, plus retinal degenerations and diabetes, and 70 normal subjects, then compared to SD-OCT (Aim 3). Finally, images will be taken of the same subjects using Aeon's Phase I autofluorescence system (DLO-AF) and compared to OCT to determine the cost-benefit of incorporating autofluorescence (AF) imaging functionality into our DLO system. The aging of the population make the need for lower cost but high quality products an urgent one.

2640,Augmenting the Efficacy of Benzodiazepine Taper with Telehealth-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety Disorders in Patients Using Prescription Opioids,"Taking prescription opioids for pain together with benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety disorders is not recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of the elevated risk of serious complications, including fatal overdose. However, this concurrent prescription use continues to be prevalent, likely due to the high comorbidity between pain and anxiety disorders. Efforts are urgently needed to reduce benzodiazepine use among patients taking opioids. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders, and represents a safer and more effective treatment for anxiety disorders compared to benzodiazepines. The proposed study aims to make minor adaptations to a CBT protocol to facilitate benzodiazepine tapering and to then conduct a 2-arm randomized clinical trial with primary care patients who receive benzodiazepine and opioid prescriptions. Participants will be randomized to receive a telehealth- delivered intervention consisting of a gentle, 12-week benzodiazepine taper (BZT) with either CBT or a health education control (HE). Participants will be assessed at baseline, several points throughout treatment, at post- treatment, and at a 3-month follow-up assessment on benzodiazepine use, opioid use, and anxiety symptoms. Should CBT + BZT outperform HE + BZT, this intervention could make a significant impact by reducing major consequences of concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines, including mortality.",R21,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10355810,R21DA053394,R21DA053394-01A1,53394,A1,,2022,1,1695,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
2644,Characterizing variability in hearing aid outcomes among older adults,"The advanced signal-processing algorithms used in digital hearing aids have improved average hearing aid benefit and satisfaction. However, response to hearing aids is highly variable, with some individuals reporting much more benefit than others. This variability is most evident among older listeners. An important issue is what levels of advanced hearing aid processing are necessary to achieve success with hearing aids in individual listeners. Every form of nonlinear signal processing has its own set of trade-offs of improved audibility versus increased modification of the signal caused by the signal processing. However, there are no effective procedures for determining who will benefit from the processing or how the processing should be adjusted for the individual listener. The long term goal of this research is use evidence-based clinical tests to guide the selection of signal processing that is most appropriate for individual older adults wearing hearing aids in their own listening environments. The first specific aim of this study is to characterize variability in response to signal manipulation among older adults and to determine what patient factors are related to that variability. The first experiment measures response to signal modification caused by several types of hearing aid processing under controlled laboratory conditions and relates those responses to patient factors. The second experiment extends those concepts to wearable hearing aids in the listener's own environment. The second specific aim is to determine prospectively the appropriate level of hearing-aid signal manipulation for an individual and to validate that determination, under clinical conditions. The third experiment will translate the results from the first two experiments into a set of patient tests that can be used clinically to predict the optimal signal processing for an individual. Listener response to hearing aid signal processing will include aided speech intelligibility, aided sound quality, and/or perceived reduction of hearing handicap.

2649,Neural Mechanisms of Vibroacoustically Augmented Breath Focused Mindfulness for Dissociative Traumatized People,"Dissociation is a multifaceted, transdiagnostic, and disabling phenomenon that involves detachment from the self or surroundings. It is prevalent in traumatized people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), occurs in other disorders including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia, and is a barrier to recovery in first-line treatments. Dissociation is characterized by attentional impairments and disruptions in body awareness, or interoception. Mindfulness-based meditative practices, including breath-focused mindfulness meditation (BFM), are designed to enhance attentional control through focused awareness on interoceptive cues (breath). However, this is a nearly impossible task for dissociative people, who experience disruptions in body agency and are unable to access or trust body signals. Exteroceptive feedback enhances interoceptive awareness and body agency in experimental studies and may similarly enhance attentional control with minimal cognitive effort. As such, the goal of this study is to address deficits in interoception and attentional control in dissociative traumatized patients via BFM augmented with exteroceptive feedback. This is delivered by a unique device that vibrates in concert with respiration, yielding non-ignorable mechanoreceptor reactivity to breathing. Using a stimulus-driven mechanism, our device is expected to enhance body agency and efficiently engage attention and interoception networks. We will recruit 200 traumatized people with clinically significant dissociation symptoms, divided in four equal groups to yield a 2x2 (breath-focused meditation or rest x with or without vibroacoustic stimulation) design. All participants will attend 8 sessions of their assigned intervention. We will administer attentional control and interoception tasks during fMRI pre- and post-intervention to examine: Aim 1) whether BFM with exteroceptive feedback engages attentional control and interoceptive networks to a significantly greater degree than the other treatment conditions from pre- to post- intervention. We will also examine: Aim 2) whether changes in neural network response correspond with changes in dissociation (and secondarily, other trauma-related problems) to a greater degree in BFM with exteroceptive feedback as compared to the other treatment conditions. The immediate impact of this research is to overcome neurobiological barriers to treatment response in dissociation using novel technology. The long-term impact will be to inform the development of publicly-disseminable devices that can augment current interventi ons.",R01,AT,NCCIH,AT,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10137701,R01AT011267,R01AT011267-01,11267,,,2021,1,1704,Chris,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
2690,Bilateral Cochlear Implants: Physiology and Psychophysics,"Bilateral cochlear implantation provides benefits over unilateral implantation for sound localization and speech reception in noise, yet binaural performance of bilateral cochlear implant (CI) users is still well below normal, especially in task involving interaural time differences (ITD), and especially in pre-lingually deaf subjects. The present collaboration between neurophysiologists and psychophysicists aims at gaining a basic understanding of the stimulus, neural, perceptual and developmental factors that influence ITD sensitivity with bilateral CIs in order to devise innovative stimulation and rehabilitation strateges that improve binaural performance. Psychophysical experiments in bilaterally-implanted human subjects will be conducted in parallel with single-unit recordings from the auditory midbrain in a novel, awake rabbit model of bilateral CIs that allows neural recordings over several months. Specific Aim 1 is to investigate whether the abnormalities in neural ITD sensitivity previously observed in neonatally deaf animals can be reversed by appropriate chronic electric stimulation through bilateral CIs. We will compare neural ITD sensitivity in neonatally-deafened rabbits that receive various types of chronic electric stimulation from an early age with the sensitivity in dea rabbits that receive minimal stimulation. Some of the rabbits will receive stimulation with an experimental strategy that was specifically designed to deliver ITD information effectively with bilateral CIs, and some rabbits will only receive unilateral stimulation as occurs during the perio of unilateral deafness between the two cochlear implantations when these are performed in separate operations. The combination of neonatal deafening, controlled electric stimulation through CIs and longitudinal neural recording in awake animals offers a powerful new approach for studying the developmental plasticity of the binaural system. Specific Aim 2 is to test a new approach for overcoming the severe degradation in ITD sensitivity observed at the high carrier pulse rates used in today's speech processors by introducing additional carrier pulses so as to create short interpulse intervals (IPIs). This approach is motivated by our finding that neurons that short IPIs in irregular pulse trains can restore firing and ITD sensitivity in neurons that ony respond to the onset of high-rate periodic pulse trains. Neural and perceptual ITD sensitivities will be compared with and without short IPIs for both simple pulse trains and modulated pulse trains resembling the current waveforms produced by CI processors with speech syllable inputs. Together, these aims will increase our basic understanding of how stimulation parameters and early auditory experience shape performance with bilateral CIs. They will likely lead to new processing strategies and rehabilitation procedures for bilateral CIs that work better in everyday acoustic environments with spatially separated sound sources, and that are adapted to the history of auditory experience and deprivation of individual deaf patients.",R01,DC,NIDCD,DC,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8811926,R01DC005775,R01DC005775-12,5775,,,2015,12,1746,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
2707,Development of a Wearable Fluorescence Imaging Device for Intraoperative Identification of Brain Tumors,"Approximately 700,000 people in the United States have been diagnosed with a primary brain tumor. Of these, malignant gliomas (MGs) account for approximately 40% of all intracranial tumors, with an overall patient survival rate of only ~34%. More than any other cancer, brain cancer has lasting physical, cognitive, and psychological impacts on a patient's life, and the highest per-patient initial cost of care. Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of therapy and the extent of resection correlates with patient survival. A limiting factor for resection, however, is the surgeon's ability to differentiate the tumor from normal tissue. In pursuit of intraoperative guidance for the safe and maximal resection, fluorescence-guided surgery has emerged as an advanced adjunctive technique. The uses of surgical operative microscopes with FDA-approved fluorescein dye have shown significantly higher tumor resection rates (75-100%) in MGs than conventional surgeries (30-55%). However, most clinical-grade fluorescence microscopes (e.g., PENTERO® 900 microscope with YELLOW 560™ fluorescein module, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG) are hampered by high costs (~$330K), limited portability (~800 lbs), and lack of operation flexibility. Many surgeons prefer, and continue to use wearable surgical eye loupes, which allow for convenient and fast operation, but are not capable of fluorescence visualization. To overcome limitations of currently available surgical imaging techniques, we have preliminarily demonstrated safety and feasibility of an innovative wearable fluorescence prototype that piggybacks on eye loupes for identifying MGs (Pending Patent: PCT/US2018/41418). In this Phase-I study, we will collaborate with a startup company (Bioptics Technology, LLC) to miniaturize, optimize, and validate this low-cost device (~$8K) with user experience (e.g., ease of wearing, alignment, and operation) for easy and accurate fluorescent identification of MGs during resection. Compact LEDs and a small CMOS camera with dedicated optical filters will be optically integrated into different functional modules for florescence excitation and detection. These lightweight, compact, and inexpensive modules will be attached to the eye loupes to form an integrated wearable device, allowing for real-time ocular observation and video recording of fluorescence and color images. The device operating system will be optimized to be ""up and running"" so that neurosurgeons can easily use it without much specialized training. To ensure appropriate performance and sufficient accuracy, this device will be first optimized and calibrated using tumor-simulating phantoms against the PENTERO® 900 microscope with YELLOW 560™ (Aim 1), and then validated in patients with MGs against histopathological analyses of biopsied samples taken from the surgical tumor margin (Aim 2). The potential market size of this device would be tens of millions of dollars in the US alone, providing a significant opportunity for commercialization. Ultimately, this affordable, wearable, and ergonomic device will significantly increase the ability of more surgeons to conduct fast and thorough operations, and thus improve surgical outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.",R41,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9841308,R41CA243600,R41CA243600-01,243600,,,2019,1,1764,Chris,,,,,,,,,
2716,Walk with Me (WWM) for Perinatal Grief,"The loss of a child during pregnancy and the early postpartum period causes significant psychological distress for many women and their partners and may lead to long-lasting psychological impairment and disorder such as posttraumatic stress, prolonged grief, and suicide. Approximately 24,000 babies in the United States are stillborn each year and over 14,000 infants die within the first 30 days of life. About 15% of parents will experience a miscarriage and more than 30% of women who experience a miscarriage meet the diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder. Currently, there are limited efficacious and accessible treatments to attenuate the effects of trauma and intense grief that are common to perinatal loss. Prior research has found online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to be effective for reducing perinatal grief and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. However, there is a need for programs that provide support beyond cognitive reappraisal to offer concrete strategies to reduce distress and increase availability for attachment to subsequent pregnancies including mindfulness practice and the inclusion of guiding principles for working with parents who have experienced perinatal loss. Using guiding principles of grief and infusing practical strategies to reduce distress for bereaved parents such as facilitating partner engagement and examples of grief rituals are be important additions to components of cognitive behavioral therapy for this population. Additionally, bereaved parents may experience damaging communication from health care professionals (HCPs) who lack sufficient training. There are no readily available tools that blend HCP training with direct support for bereaved parents. The goal of this phase I project is to create a prototype of a mobile application that demonstrates promise of effectiveness for reducing parent distress (traumatic stress and intensity of grief) following a perinatal loss. We will accomplish this goal by accomplishing our three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Use an iterative formative development process to develop training and modules for grief processing and healing activities leveraging cognitive behavioral therapy and guiding principles for working with parents who have experienced perinatal loss. Specific Aim 2: Develop prototype featuring core components of the application. Specifically, HCP training and four key modules for bereaved parents including two on normalization of grief, one on mindfulness to facilitate coping with trauma and distress symptoms and one using CBT strategies to manage negative thoughts. Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the acceptability, usability, and effectiveness of Walk with Me by conducting a mixed-methods program evaluation with HCPs and bereaved parents to optimize the successful use of Walk with Me.",R43,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10322941,R43MH126788,R43MH126788-01A1,126788,A1,,2021,1,1773,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2729,Endocrine and metabolic diseases in rural South Africa-establishing burden and improving detection,"This award will support the career development and training of Dr Alisha Wade, an endocrinologist and clinician scientist with an interest in endocrine and metabolic diseases in lower and middle income countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Endocrine and metabolic disorders (EMDs) are significant contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide, but little is known about their relative prevalence in rural South Africa, where multiple independent risk factors such as HIV/AIDS, antiretroviral therapy, increasing life expectancy in adulthood and nutritional transitions interact in ways that likely make the relative burden of EMDs different from high income countries. Early detection and treatment of EMDs would reduce morbidity and mortality, but broad-based population screening in primary care is impractical in low resource settings. Integrating targeted case finding in those at highest risk for key EMDs into routine primary care may prove cost-effective. The long-term objective of this work to identify those individuals in South Africa at highest risk of key EMDs and their sequelae and to develop a cost-effective, pragmatic strategy for their long-term identification and management. The specific aims of the project are to (1) determine the relative prevalence and risk factors of key EMDs in a population based sample of 1630 adults aged 40 years and over in a Black South African population with high prevalence of HIV and HAART use, (2) determine the feasibility of implementing use of a mobile application in primary care to support integration of case-finding for common endocrine and metabolic disorders and (3) determine the cost effectiveness of integrating a case-finding approach to identifying EMDs into primary care. These studies will be nested within the NIA-funded HAALSI project and the NHGRI-funded AWI-Gen project. This research will allow the applicant to develop skills in advanced biostatistics and epidemiology, development and evaluation of complex interventions and health economics, with an emphasis on cost effectiveness analysis, to support her long term career objective of become an independent clinician scientist investigating the evolution of EMDs against the backdrop of high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in lower and middle income countries and developing cost-effective interventions for their detection and management. The applicant will be mentored primarily by Dr. Anne Cappola at the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Stephen Tollman at the University of the Witwatersrand, experts in the endocrinology of aging and aging in LMICs respectively. She will be well supported by the facilities at the University of the Witwatersrand, one of the leading African research institutes.

2730,Biomimetic Wearable Sensors for Alcohol Monitoring,"According to the 2015 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 15.1 million adults had alcohol use disorder in the United States. Alcoholism has been identified as an important risk factor for illness, disability, and mortality, carrying a huge economic and societal burden. Real-time, accurate and discreet devices for the assessment of Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) are essential to empower medical research with reliable reliable means to monitor alcohol behavior, as well as for effective personal self-assessment. Measurement of ethanol perspired through the skin by means of wearable devices is of particular interest for the possibility to perform discreet and unobtrusive monitoring of BAC, but available devices are still lacking reliability, accuracy and sensitivity. In this context, Bioinspira, Inc. has developed a versatile bacteriophage-based, colorimetric sensor platform technology for gas sensing. The novel, in-house developed technology uses a self-assembling bacteriophage sensor array (M13 bacteriophage) that can be genetically engineered to bind to specific gas molecules and change its color pattern based on type of gas and concentration. By leveraging this innovative technology, through this SBIR phase I study Bioinspira will assess the feasibility of realizing a wearable Biomimetic Sensor for Transdermal Alcohol Monitoring (BiosTAM) for real-time monitoring of ethanol vapor that evaporates through the skin. Preliminary laboratory data showed the ability of BioInspira's platform technology to detect ethanol. The development of a phage-based ethanol sensor with high will fill a technological gap in alcohol behavior monitoring, enabling more comprehensive and detailed medical studies, and will offer the possibility to monitor and manage personal alcohol use disorder. In SBIR Phase I, the technical feasibility of detecting ethanol vapor selectively, sensitively and real-time will be assessed. To this extent, the following R&D activities will be conducted: 1. Production and evaluation of gas phage array candidates for the selective and sensitive detection of ethanol vapor; 2. Calibration of the best performing phage sensor candidate for the detection of ethanol concentration under different temperature and relative humidity conditions. The results obtained will be preparatory for a SBIR Phase II, where the clinical trials will be performed for the correlation of transdermal alcohol measurements with BAC.

2738,User-centric development of closed-loop therapy for opioid overdose,"This Fast-Track SBIR proposal will help make significant inroads towards commercializing Rescue Biomedical LLC's automatic antidote delivery device (A2D2) in order to combat opioid overdose-related deaths. Despite increasing awareness of the dangers associated with opioids, there were more than 70,000 deaths due to opioid overdose in 2020. In addition, the rising popularity of illegal synthetic opioids and social isolation due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is fueling a third wave of opioid-related deaths. Since these illegal drugs are orders of magnitude more potent than morphine and can cause respiratory failure in minutes, there is very little time for users to identify and respond to the symptoms of overdose with antidotes like naloxone. The proposed A2D2 is a low-cost and simple subcutaneous drug delivery capsule that can automatically detect opioid- induced respiratory failure and release naloxone in a closed-loop manner. It will extend the lifetime of overdosed patients so that they can receive proper medical care. In this Fast-Track SBIR proposal, Rescue Biomedical seeks to validate its hypothesis that there is a significant demand for a wearable-implantable combinational device for automatically detecting and treating opioid overdose. In Phase I, Rescue Biomedical will work with its collaborator at Indiana University School of Medicine to quantify users' willingness to use wearable and implantable devices. Furthermore, clinicians and other stakeholders (e.g., Licensed Chemical Dependency Counselor) will be identified to understand their willingness to recommend advanced harm reduction devices. Finally, Rescue Biomedical will leverage the cohort of these stakeholders to validate the overall system design to ensure high compliance and usability. In Phase II, efforts will be focused on technical integration and performing a pivotal pre-clinical experiment to demonstrate the closed-loop capabilities to reverse the effects of opioid overdose. Moreover, Rescue Biomedical will focus efforts for commercialization including regulatory submissions for IND/IDE submission and performing design verification and validation based on user feedback.",R44,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10485478,R44DA056277,R44DA056277-01,56277,,,2022,1,1795,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
2748,A Gait and Path Tortuosity System for Monitoring Cognitive Decline from Daily Functions in Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and/or Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD),"Proposed is a sensing system that unobtrusively measures and reports gait properties which are correlated to accepted measures of cognitive decline. Significance: It is estimated that as of 2018 over 5.7 million Americans are afflicted with AD. Due to the aging demographics, this number is projected to double by 2050 at an estimated annual direct cost of $1.1 trillion. Measures of cognitive decline can help to inform family members, caregivers, and health-care providers about the functional status and needs of independent-living older individuals. The need to improve the assessment of cognitive changes affecting daily functions has been identified by the NIH and National Academy of Medicine (NAM). Many ADLs such as shopping, housecleaning, and bathing are difficult to objectively measure. Measuring these ADLs is generally manually intensive often requiring direct supervision by a caregiver. The changing demographics of the elderly mean now more elderly adults will no longer have the frequent interaction with caregivers required to accurately make these measures. Hypothesis: A system capable of measuring and reporting gait parameters which are correlated to accepted measures of cognitive decline can decrease caregivers' burden and increase quality of life for individuals with AD. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Generate user- centric requirements through focus group discussions; 2) Develop prototype system electronics and mechanical packaging; 3) Perform laboratory study of prototype functionality; and 4) Evaluate prototype performance through pilot human study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to accurately measure requisite gait measures and demonstrate the usability of the system by the target population.",R43,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,9778069,R43AG063679,R43AG063679-01,63679,,,2019,1,1805,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2750,Rehabilitation at home using mobile health in older adults after hospitalization for ischemic heart disease (RESILIENT),"Participation in ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation (CR) by patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) remains low. By recent estimates, fewer than two thirds of eligible patients are referred, and fewer than half of those referred participate. Even among those referred, multiple barriers to participation include limited facilities, competing time demands, high out-of-pocket costs, and prolonged wait time. Barriers to CR are particularly high in older adults (age ≥70), due to factors such as physical impairments or transportation barriers, although these patients may simultaneously have the greatest potential to benefit. Mobile health-enabled CR (mHealth- CR) for IHD - which involves delivery of CR via portable electronic devices - has the potential to increase engagement by reducing participation barriers, but it remains largely untested outside of small studies in relatively healthy young persons. It is therefore unclear what proportion of older adults with IHD and barriers to traditional CR are able to engage with mHealth-CR, and whether mHealth-CR leads to better outcomes than usual care. Therefore, we propose RESILIENT: Rehabilitation at home using mobile health in older adults after hospitalization for ischemic heart disease. This is a prospective, multicenter, non-blinded randomized clinical trial (with blinded assessment of primary endpoint) to evaluate engagement and outcomes with mHealth-CR among older adults with IHD, identified at the time of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The trial will be conducted at two academic medical centers: NYU School of Medicine and Yale School of Medicine, which collectively serve a diverse patient population and have a track record of successfully recruiting older adults in clinical research studies. We will randomize 400 older adults with IHD to receive mHealth-CR (n=300) or usual care (n=100) for 3 months. Our intervention combines mHealth-CR software, delivered via a tablet device, with baseline counseling and weekly phone calls by an exercise therapist over 3 months. Intervention and usual care groups will also receive a standard referral to ambulatory CR in accordance with guidelines, as well as dynamic assessment of activities of daily living (ADLs). The primary efficacy endpoint is change in functional capacity, assessed by 6 minute walk distance. Secondary efficacy endpoints are goal attainment, health status, ADLs, hospital readmission, and death. The engagement endpoint is defined by weekly completion of mHealth-CR tasks. We hypothesize that mHealth-CR will improve a range of outcomes, and that distinct patterns of engagement will be discerned. The PI for this project (Dr. Dodson) is an Early Stage Investigator with a focus on cardiovascular outcomes research among older adults; additional investigators have a wide range of expertise in geriatrics, biostatistics, behavioral science, cardiac rehabilitation, and computer science.

2761,SCH: INT: AURA - Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to lmprove Care at Home,"An effective care transition from hospital to home is crucial to ensure optimal care for high-risk patients and to reduce the cost of avoidable readmissions that burdens the healthcare system. A common practice in technology-assisted care transition is to train and guide patients and family caregivers through the web and mobile phone-based systems for symptom reporting, vital signs monitoring, and providing feedback. Although effective, these systems have three major limitations: (a) the patient or caregiver has to actively measure and enter data into the system-which is error-prone, subjective, and often forgotten; (b) web or mobile-based interactions can be cumbersome and demanding-tasks like entering data, knowing health status, or getting and responding to an alert require typing and clicking through a series of forms/web pages; and (c) feedback from the system through messages and notifications is often ineffective and unnoticed. To overcome these limitations, this project employs a data-driven approach to develop a voice-enabled, context-aware, post-treatment self-care system in home settings. The proposed system will (a) monitor specific activities of a patient at home using advanced WiFi radio signal-based human activity recognition algorithms; (b) tailor natural language responses of voice assistants like Amazon Echo/Alexa based on the patient's location, activity, and health history; and (c) automate data-entry and reporting to reduce patient or caregiver burden. The system will be deployed in 40 colorectal and bladder cancer patients' homes for assessing usability, feasibility, and preliminary magnitude of benefits. The overarching goals of this project are aligned with the NLM's 10-year strategic plan for 2017-2027. Through automated collection, linking, curation, and modeling of voice and WiFi radio sensor data, this project will create an interconnected ecosystem of digital biomarkers that explain, influence, and predict health outcomes during care transition. By using low-cost voice assistants (less than $50) and ubiquitous home WiFi, it maximizes the dissemination and engagement of data-powered health to mass population. To foster the development of a data-ready workforce for the future, three Ph.D. students will work in this multidisciplinary project, a new mHealth course will be developed, and open science practices will be applied during the development, deployment, and dissemination phases of the project.",R01,LM,NLM,LM,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9928253,R01LM013329,R01LM013329-01,13329,,,2019,1,1818,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
2775,Be Well at Work-Plus: Engaging low-wage workers in the design and implementation of a depression and physical activity intervention.,"Depression and physical inactivity are leading contributors to cardiometabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Low-wage workers, who comprise one-third of all workers in the U.S. and are essential to many industries, are more likely to be physically inactive and to have cardiometabolic conditions and depression, yet they are half as likely as higher wage workers to utilize preventive care. Targeted workplace initiatives have been successful in improving employee health, but low-wage workers are difficult to engage, in part due to a high burden of social disadvantage (e.g., food and housing insecurity, time and financial constraints). Currently, to our knowledge, there are no workplace interventions for depression that specifically target low-wage workers and their unique social risk factors. This study was conceptualized using a planned adaptation approach that involves low-wage workers in the design of the intervention to increase engagement and feasibility in this population. The proposed study will adapt an evidence-based 8-session telephone-delivered depression intervention for working adults, Be Well at Work, and add critical enhancements for low-wage workers: assessment and referrals for social determinants of health, physical activity promotion, and personalized text message behavioral support via ecological momentary assessment and intervention. The adapted intervention, Be Well at Work-PLUS, will be developed and tested in three phases: (1) qualitative interviews with low-wage workers to understand social determinants of health, barriers and facilitators of engagement, and intervention preferences (Aim 1); (2) a single-arm pilot (N=10) with exit interviews to refine the intervention content and delivery (Aim 2); (3) a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing Be Well at Work-PLUS to a waitlist condition (N=60; Aim 3). This iterative process will yield results on feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical outcomes of Be Well at Work-PLUS and provide data to apply for an R01 efficacy trial. To compliment these research aims, Dr. McCurley has designed a training plan to gain expertise in (1) implementation science, including planned adaptation of evidence-based interventions and participatory design methods for improving reach and engagement in low-income groups, (2) mobile health, specifically, text messaging for increased intervention feasibility and uptake; and (3) randomized controlled trial design. The career development plan involves regular mentorship with experts in implementation science, mobile health, randomized behavioral intervention trials, as well as didactic courses and workshops in these topics, dissemination of results through presentations and publications, and support for grant writing and additional skill development to advance Dr. McCurley's career as an independent behavioral scientist.

2782,A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention for Rural Latino Children,"K23 Abstract A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention for Rural Latino Children DESCRIPTION: Rural Latino children with asthma suffer high rates of uncontrolled asthma symptoms, emergency department visits, and repeat hospitalizations. This vulnerable population must negotiate micro and macro level challenges that impact asthma management, including language barriers, primary care access, parental time off from work, insurance coverage, distance from specialty sites, and documentation status. There are few proven interventions that address asthma management embedded within this unique context. Using a bio-ecological approach, we will determine the feasibility of a patient-centered collaborative program between rural Latino children with asthma and their families, school based nursing, and primary care providers, facilitated by the use of a smart phone based mobile application (mobile app) with a Spanish-language interface. We hypothesize that improving communication through a collaborative, patient-centered intervention will improve asthma management, empower the patient and family, decrease outcome disparities, and decrease direct and indirect costs. The specific aims of this study include: 1) Produce and validate a Spanish translation of an existing asthma management app and evaluate its usability with Latino parents of children with asthma; 2) Develop and evaluate a triadic, patient-centered asthma intervention preliminary protocol, facilitated by the bilingual mobile app validated in aim 1; and 3) Investigate the feasibility of the patient-centered asthma intervention from aim 2 using a wait list randomized control trial (RCT) to investigate the effects of the intervention on school days missed and medication adherence. The results of this study will be used to support a full scale randomized control trial R01 grant application in Year 4 of this award. The career development award will provide Dr. Estrada the mentoring and training needed to develop knowledge and skills in rural asthma disparities research, intervention development and program evaluation, and integration of technology- based interventions.

2786,Development of a Mobile Health Personalized Physiologic Analytics Tool for Pediatric Patients with Sepsis,"Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, encompasses a continuum that ranges from sepsis to severe sepsis, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and eventually death if untreated. Sepsis is the leading cause of child mortality worldwide, with most of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) yet few clinical tools have been developed for identifying, monitoring, or managing septic children in LMICs. There is immense potential for novel clinical tools that can help clinicians more rapidly identify children with advanced stages of sepsis (severe sepsis, septic shock and MODS), who are at highest risk for decompensation and death. Mobile health (mHealth) tools, wearable devices, and artificial intelligence techniques have rapidly proliferated for a multitude of medical applications and could serve to bridge the gap in care of critically ill patients in LMIC settings. By enabling the detection of subtle physiologic changes indicating clinical deterioration, these tools may allow clinicians to intervene earlier, better direct care, and allocate scarce resources, all without the need for advanced laboratory diagnostics or critical care infrastructure. Furthermore, remote monitoring capabilities may also prove highly valuable in improving patient care and protecting the safety of healthcare workers during times of infectious disease outbreaks such as from novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). This proposed research will develop a context-appropriate mHealth tool linking continuous physiologic data obtained from a wearable device with a novel machine learning approach known as personalized physiologic analytics (PPA) run on a standard smartphone to provide clinicians with accurate assessments of sepsis severity and mortality risk in septic children admitted to the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). Formative research among clinicians at icddr,b will be used to develop this mHealth tool incorporating the PPA algorithm with a clinical decision support and alert system for use by front-line clinicians. Finally, the tool's feasibility, usability, and accuracy for detection of sepsis severity and MODS will be validated in a new population of pediatric patients with sepsis. Knowledge gained from this study will greatly advance the evidence base for the use of mHealth tools and artificial intelligence techniques to help clinicians worldwide better care for critically ill children in LMIC settings earlier in the course of their disease, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality from sepsis. The results of this investigational research will be used to inform a multi-center clinical trial which would seek to assess the impact of using this mHealth tool on clinical outcomes as well as the cost-effectiveness of this tool. This tool may also provide an effective means of assessing patient responses to various therapeutic interventions via continuous physiologic monitoring in future clinical trials.

2788,Long-Term Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Self-Management of Chronic Conditions: The C3 Study,"We will extend an active NIA cohort study of diverse, middle age and older adults with ≥1 chronic conditions to assess COVID-19's long-term and disparate impact on health and healthcare experiences. COVID-19 has become an unprecedented public health threat in modern times, especially for older adults with a chronic illness. As of January 2021, 94% of COVID deaths have been among adults over 55; 92% of those who have died had ≥1 underlying health conditions. Beyond consequences to personal health associated with acquiring COVID-19, the impact of the pandemic may likely extend to non-COVID-19 outcomes as a patient's ability to self-manage chronic conditions during and after a pandemic may be compromised for several reasons. In March 2020, our team rapidly launched the COVID-19 & Chronic Conditions (C3) study as cases of COVID-19 emerged in the U.S. to assess how adults with ≥1 chronic conditions were responding to the pandemic. Five active studies with uniform data collection on a range of patient-reported outcomes prior to COVID-19 and with electronic health records access were leveraged to establish the C3 cohort; 673 adults in Chicago were interviewed during the 1st week of the outbreak. The cohort was immediately expanded using two of the 'parent studies' that also had sites in New York City (n=200; N=873). C3 participants are diverse by socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, gender, health literacy, and comorbidity. An NIA COVID-19 supplement was awarded in August 2020 to expand the cohort via the parent studies (N=1200) and continue data collection up to 2022; 5 of 7 planned survey waves have been completed (83-94% retention). C3 findings reveal many adults exhibit sustained, high stress due to COVID-19 that impacts lifestyle, treatment adherence, and healthcare use. Disparities by sex, race, ethnicity, and SES also are present. Health professionals and researchers are now voicing concern for possible long-term consequences of COVID-19 on personal health & healthcare. In response, we propose to continue to follow the C3 cohort to capture data 5 years post onset of the U.S. outbreak. All participants will have a 'Pre-COVID' baseline and 7+ follow-up assessments to assess trajectories in health care use, patient-reported & chronic disease outcomes. Our primary aims are to: 1) evaluate changes in lifestyle, health behaviors, healthcare use, health status, and chronic disease outcomes from a pre-pandemic baseline through 5 years after onset of COVID-19; 2) determine the extent to which stress, anxiety, and depression contribute to poor health status and chronic disease outcomes through 5 years after the pandemic's onset. Our secondary aim is to: 3) identify factors that mediate or moderate associations between stress, anxiety, and depression during/after the pandemic with health status and chronic disease outcomes, while our exploratory aim is to: 4) explore whether health disparities by age, sex, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status emerge or worsen during/after the pandemic and the contributing role of stress, anxiety, and depression.",R01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10342940,R01AG075043,R01AG075043-01,75043,,,2022,1,1845,Josh,,,,,,,,,
2789,Developing a method to increase HIV testing among YMSM,"Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to HIV and account for one quarter of all new infections each year. Most new infections (72%) among adolescents occur among young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Transmission of HIV can be virtually eliminated by treatment, but testing rates are low and a significant proportion of YMSM are unaware of their HIV status. Perceived and actual stigma and discrimination may prevent these young men from engaging in health systems and very few programs have been designed to effectively promote testing among YMSM. This Phase I project will create a theory-based (Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills model), serious mobile game to promote HIV testing among YMSM living on the South and West sides of Chicago. Communities comprised predominately of African American and Latino communities. Three specific aims will be completed over a six-month period: (1) Develop the Test prototype with a stakeholder advisory team; (2) Conduct prototype usability, feasibility, and acceptability testing with youth and providers; and (3) prepare for Phase II full development. The Test will directly address the need for innovative solutions to low rates of HIV testing among YMSM using a state-of-the-art, theory-based video game designed specifically for YMSM. This game will engage YMSM in self- paced, developmentally appropriate, interactive instruction and practice to enhance their information, motivation, and behavioral skills with regards HIV testing.",R41,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9147173,R41HD088328,R41HD088328-01,88328,,,2016,1,1846,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
2790,Long-Term Effects of COVID-19 and Health Care Delivery Changes on Health Disparity Populations Living with Multiple Chronic Conditions,"People living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) consume a high proportion of health care resources but are not well-served by one-disease-at-a-time scientific evidence and health care delivery systems. Primary care, focused on the whole person in their family and community context, has great but under-informed potential to integrate the care of people with MCC, particularly community health centers (CHCs) that focus on health disparity populations. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting societal and health care system responses have uncovered tremendous care disparities, while also stimulating innovations with great potential to foster integrated personalized primary care for people with MCC in an otherwise fragmented, impersonal, inequitable health care system. In particular, telehealth visits in the context of ongoing person- focused relationships, integrated mental health services, and outreach to high-risk patients with MCC provide hope for advancing the equity and quality of care for health disparity populations. We have a unique opportunity to study the effects of the pandemic in a national network of 926 community health centers serving >2.6 million patients from health disparity populations. The proposed study will: 1) Identify evolving changes in health care delivery to people with MCC in community health centers in response to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath; 2) Assess the impact of these practice changes on care quality for people living with MCC; 3) Identify promising emerging strategies to improve health care for people living with MCC. We will conduct a time series analysis of practice changes and associated patient outcomes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Monthly analyses will examine changes in practice processes, patient outcomes, and workforce stability for health disparity populations and for people with and without multiple chronic conditions. For a five-year period going back to January 2020 ― the month of the first known COVID- 19 case in the US and the start of responding public health and practice changes ― we will analyze and publicly report, on a monthly basis, practice changes and patient outcomes, to rapidly inform decision making about primary care of health disparity populations with MCC. Subgroup analyses will examine differences across 26 states that have had different societal and policy responses to the pandemic. The findings from these quantitative analyses of millions of patients being seen in hundreds of community health centers will be used to identify a purposive sample of exemplars for in-depth case studies that put a face on the quantitative findings and identify and characterize practice innovations that show promise in reducing health care disparities and improving care for people living with MCC. Study findings will generate vital new knowledge on the effect of a pandemic on the quality and equity of care provided to people MCC and will inform efforts to improve health care equity after a natural disaster.",R01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10336261,R01AG074946,R01AG074946-01,74946,,,2021,1,1847,Josh,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2808,"14th International Conference on HIV Treatment, Pathogenesis, and Prevention Research (INTEREST)","The most recent UNAIDS estimates of the global burden of HIV are that 36.9 million people are living with HIV-1 infection worldwide, with 69.4% of these residing in sub-Saharan Africa. Markedly, three in four new infections in sub-Saharan Africa are among girls aged 15-19 years and young women aged 15-24 years are twice as likely to be living with HIV than men that age. Further, a striking difference exists between the east/southern and the west/central regions of sub-Saharan Africa, with reductions in AIDS-related deaths since 2010 of 42% and 24%, respectively. Clearly, much work remains in terms of training local physicians and scientists in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of individuals with HIV-1 infection; conducting implementation science to determine the most cost-effective use of financial and human resources; and ensuring evidence-informed public health policy and programming to reduce disparities in the AIDS response across Africa's sub-regions. Despite treatment likely having contributed to slowing HIV transmission, HIV prevention remains critical to stem the tide of HIV. In fact, a second AIDS pandemic in the next 12 years is predicted due to 1) changing demographics in Africa with increasing numbers of youth, 2) increasing transmitted viral drug resistance, and 3) increased cost and limited availability of 2nd and 3rd line treatment regimens. Taken together, these factors suggest that the total number of people living with AIDS may increase by 2 million/year to reach a staggering 50 million worldwide by 2030. Since 2007, 13 successful annual INTEREST Conferences, known as the 'African CROI', have brought together scientists involved in HIV diagnosis and treatment, pathogenesis, and prevention research in resource-limited settings in Africa to share pivotal findings, promote collaboration, and transfer experiences across several fields and many continents. Planning and organization of the 2020 INTEREST Conference will be overseen by the Amsterdam Institute of Global Health and Development. Catherine Hankins MD PhD chairs INTEREST's International Conference Committee (ICC) and is the Scientific Chair of INTEREST. The organizers of the 2020 INTEREST Conference will pursue the following objectives: 1) To provide cutting-edge knowledge in the fields of diagnosis and treatment, pathogenesis, and prevention of HIV-1 for adults, including the elderly; adolescents; and children living with HIV in Africa, in order to contribute to achieving the 90-90-90 viral suppression goal and to preventing a second great pandemic. 2) To foster new research interactions among leading investigators and those who represent the potential future scientific leadership for health care and research on the African continent.",R13,AI,NIAID,TW;AI,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10012378,R13AI152885,R13AI152885-01,152885,,,2020,1,1865,Pablo,,,,,,,,,
2831,Real-time non-intrusive workload monitoring-Integration of human factors in surgery training and assessment,"(30 lines) High physiological and cognitive workload required in de-coupled surgical work demands may have significant impact on patient outcome, surgical efficacy, and surgical performance. As novel surgical techniques, e.g., telesurgery, are developed, surgical operations will become more complex and the mental and physical demand on surgeons will likely increase, making it critical to develop remote and connected workload monitoring methods for the safe and effective surgical procedure design, testing, and training. This work will implement novel technology and machine learning analytics to quantify real-time and remote workload and test how workload feedback can impact care delivery in both in telesurgery and surgical simulation environments. Our overall hypothesis is that connected sensing technology in telesurgical procedures and simulation can improve surgical training and understanding of the impact of their workload on performance; ultimately improving patient health, surgery efficacy, and patient access (e.g., tele-mentoring) to surgical care. Two specific aims are proposed to investigate this hypothesis. The objective of Specific Aim 1 is to develop a connected sensor system to objectively quantify workload real-time in simulated telerobotic procedures. This involves: 1) integrating non-intrusive sensors into a single system within the simulation trainer or environment, 2) training machine learning techniques to objectively distinguish workload using a simulated surgical skills tasks, and 3) validating metrics across varying levels of cognitive loads under various task difficulty with medical trainees and expert participants. The objective of Specific Aim 2 is to determine the impact of the real-time workload feedback intervention on trainee performance times, errors, and intraoperative workload. Two tasks are proposed: 1) Explore modalities preferred by surgeons for providing real-time feedback on workload and 2) Assess impact of workload feedback on task performance and learning. Our primary hypothesis is that performance times and errors will improve when participants are provided realtime feedback on workload compared to performance with no feedback. The expected deliverables include 1) workload monitoring technology, algorithms, and software for complementing current simulation-based training, 2) objective and automated workload metrics, 3) real-time assistive intervention tool, and 4) preliminary evidence on impact of workload monitoring on training. The technology in this proposed work will improve public health by reducing adverse events due to human factors in surgery and improve access to surgical care with intervention technology that can adaptively train surgeons and remotely assess proficiency.",R21,EB,NIBIB,EB,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9669763,R21EB026177,R21EB026177-01A1,26177,A1,,2019,1,1888,Josh,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2847,"SymptomCare@Home (SCH): Deconstructing an effective, technology-assisted, symptom management intervention","Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy experience multiple poorly controlled symptoms at home in the interim weeks between clinic visits and the next infusion. Their care during this interim time period is suboptimal. Technology can be utilized to bridge the gap between patient symptom needs at home and oncology team response. Automated patient-reported symptom home monitoring and management systems offer a new approach to symptom care. Our research team has developed and tested SymptomCare@Home (SCH). This multi-component automated system monitors daily patient-reported symptoms at home, provides tailored automated self-management coaching based on the specific symptoms reported and transmits unrelieved symptom alert reports to an oncology provider who, using the SCH decision support system provides follow-up telephone-delivered symptom care. We have demonstrated that SCH dramatically reduces physical and psychological symptom severity. However there remain several gaps in translating a successful, multi-component symptom intervention into clinical practice. These include understanding 1) the contribution and value of each part of the intervention so that the active components are selected for clinical implementation and 2) the costs associated with the intervention and its components. Therefore the aims of this project are to deconstruct the SCH symptom monitoring and management system to determine the relative contribution and costs of its components to achieving symptom reduction, maintain general health functioning and reduce healthcare utilization. We will also examine who benefits most and least from the individual components and from the overall system. A 5 group randomized control trial design will be utilized with 750 participants (150/group) beginning a new course of chemotherapy who will call the SCH system daily and report the presence and severity of 11 symptoms throughout a course of chemotherapy or up to 6 months. This study is both significant and innovative because it shifts the current clinical practice paradigm for providing symptom care episodically during clinic visits to an innovative approach that is patient-centric, providing symptom care when and where the patient needs it. The study will address questions not generally asked in multi-component interventions, determining the active ingredients and their costs. Determining the value of new approaches to care such as automated telehealth interventions is essential to the decision process of healthcare systems and payers who decide what to adopt and reimburse. It is also vitally important to patients so that new symptom care innovations are adopted that better meet their needs and dramatically reduce their symptoms.",R01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9127518,R01CA206522,R01CA206522-01,206522,,,2016,1,1906,Pablo,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2858,Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice.",U01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,9753639,U01HL088942,U01HL088942-12,88942,,,2019,12,1917,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,

The newly formed infrastructure includes clinical and research offices, dedicated exam and consultation rooms for participants, database and computer facilities and clinical research expertise from several centers through the University of Montana. The research team is comprised of a pediatric clinician/scientist as principal investigator, two research nurses, an epidemiologist and a recently added second pediatrician. Each team member has gained experience through multiple professional development opportunities, which have included ECHO ISPCTN Data Coordinating and Operations Center-offered didactic presentations, manuscript writing team membership and leadership, clinical trial protocol development leadership, and most importantly the invaluable growth that occurs with participation in three ECHO ISPCTN clinical studies. The team is now well positioned to gain further from a robust clinical research skills development plan designed by a new Senior Faculty Development Leader, who has extensive expertise in both clinical trials and mentorship. We are ready to participate in the next phase of ongoing ECHO ISPCTN trials as well as clinical trials in development. To facilitate continued and successful pediatric clinical trial participation, we have established relationships with the major pediatric inpatient facilities in the state, including their healthcare providers and research institutions, as well as with outpatient pediatric practice groups and care providers throughout western Montana, including the Family Practice Medicine Residency and Partnership Health Center, a Federally Qualified Health Center. We have also gained support from a newly formed innovative rural outreach organization, Ahana, a telemedicine collaborative for afterhours care in rural communities. Our established and active engagement with two IDeA program-supported Clinical and Translational Research Centers in Montana has and will continue to serve as valuable resources in professional development, research design and biostatistics, and community and stakeholder engagement, the last of which is critical as we extend our ECHO ISPCTN activities into more rural areas of the state. The ECHO ISPCTN has provided a pathway for including sites in clinical trial research that have not historically done so. As we look toward the future, the overall goal is to build on the ECHO ISPCTN's and MPCTS's successes and leverage existing infrastructure to expand the reach of ECHO ISPCTN clinical trials into rural and underserved areas in Montana.

2862,Understanding Barriers to Reproductive Health Care among Women with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),"Early evidence suggests that women with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience unique challenges around reproductive and sexual health. Exacerbating these problems, autistic women face health care disparities in accessing women's health services. At Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated healthcare system, we found that women with ASD utilize gynecological care and cervical cancer screenings at nearly half the rate of women with ADHD or typical neurodevelopment. Aim 1 examines which factors, including sociodemographic characteristics, medical and psychiatric conditions, and other types of healthcare utilization may contribute to autistic women underutilizing different types of gynecologic care. Aim 2 will examine the epidemiology of pregnancy in women with ASD and whether autistic women also experience gaps in obstetric care, an area that has been largely understudied. We will sample women with and without autism using a case-control study design. There are currently 2600 adult women in the KPNC autism registry with 350 pregnancies enumerated among them. This population is growing dramatically as the wave of children diagnosed with ASD reaches adulthood. We will examine differences in obstetrics/gynecology utilization, including frequency and counts of visits, procedures, and prescriptions, in the period of January 2016 to December 2020. We will examine pregnancy history extending back to 1995, the year KPNC's outpatient databases were established. Using multivariate logistic regression, we will examine whether factors such as race/ethnicity, age at ASD diagnosis, and mental and physical health status are associated with utilization of gynecologic care among women with ASD compared with controls. We will also describe the epidemiology of pregnancy and obstetric care utilization, including ultrasounds and screenings for gestational diabetes, among autistic women compared to controls. Given the impact of COVID-19 on health care, we will conduct an analysis focused on care delivery in 2020 to explore how the shift to telemedicine may have be impacting OB/GYN care disparities between women with and without ASD. Study findings will inform the development of strategies to improve provider knowledge, care practices, and effective obstetrics/gynecology health care delivery for adult women with ASD.",R03,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10195839,R03HD105164,R03HD105164-01,105164,,,2021,1,1921,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2867,Mobile Health for Implementation of Home-based TB Contact Investigation in Uganda,"Contact investigation is a widely advocated strategy for extending tuberculosis (TB) case detection from clinics to communities through screening of household contacts of new TB patients and referral of at-risk patients for clinic-based confirmatory testing and treatment. Unfortunately, low rates of clinic follow-up among at-risk individuals represent a major barrier to implementing contact investigation in high-burden countries. In a formative evaluation based on a WHO-endorsed conceptual model of barriers to accessing TB evaluation services, we have identified a lack of patient knowledge about TB and TB evaluation, and economic and geographic barriers as the major determinants of this quality gap. The objective of this proposal is to determine if home sputum collection, supported by targeted, mobile-phone health (mHealth) messages and incentives, is an effective and scalable solution for overcoming these barriers to implementing contact investigation. The scientific approach will be to carry-out a household-randomized, controlled trial in five rural Ugandan communities comparing two approaches to evaluation of at-risk contacts: referral to clinics for TB testing (standard approach) vs. home sputum collection supported by mHealth interventions. We will use the RE-AIM framework for intervention evaluation to assess the patient and public-health impact of these interventions, using pre-specified measures of their reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Specifically, we will first determine if mHealth-facilitated home sputum collection increases rates of TB and HIV diagnosis and clinic follow-up (reach), TB treatment initiation (effectiveness), and completion (maintenance), as compared to standard contact investigation. Second, we will use quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the internal effectiveness and fidelity of the component interventions across different sites (adoption). Third, we will employ economic and epidemic modeling to estimate the costs and epidemiological impact of this intervention (implementation). The proposed research will make a significant contribution to patient care and health policy by providing comprehensive, practice-based evidence on contact investigation in a low- income country, including whether it can be implemented more widely and efficiently by decreasing unnecessary clinic referrals and increasing early identification and treatment of infectious TB patients. We have assembled a well-established team of investigators, who will take advantage of the outstanding environment for health services research with the Uganda TB Surveillance Project. Together, they will combine their expertise in innovative, multi-disciplinary methods from clinical research, behavioral science, and applied mathematics with their extensive experience in core content areas, including TB diagnosis and contact investigation; mHealth; theories of behavior change and implementation frameworks; biostatistics; and health economics to evaluate a cutting-edge, patient-centered technological intervention.",R01,AI,NIAID,AI,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,9085214,R01AI104824,R01AI104824-04,104824,,,2016,4,1926,Chris,,,,,,,,,
2881,SAGE LEAF: Reducing Burden in Alzheimer's Disease Caregivers through Positive Emotion Regulation and Virtual Support,"The prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other dementias is steadily climbing and predicted to affect as many as 16 million Americans by 2050. In 2016, 59% of dementia caregivers reported experiencing high levels of emotional and physical stress, and the risk that the chronic stress of dementia caregiving places on caregivers for developing a range of physical and mental health issues is extensively documented. Caregiving-related stress contributes to social isolation, loneliness, and physical illness and increases the risk of caregiver death. Interventions for dementia caregivers have primarily focused on reducing negative emotions and burden. However, over the past few decades, it has become clear that positive emotions are uniquely related to better psychological and physical well-being, independent of the effects of negative emotion suggesting that an intervention that specifically targets positive emotion holds promise for improving caregiver well-being and, ultimately, quality of care for the individual living with AD. Our recent randomized trial of the positive emotion skills intervention, delivered by trained facilitators via the web in N = 170 family caregivers of people with dementia resulted in significant improvements in caregiver psychological well being. However, facilitator-delivered interventions are costly and difficult to implement with fidelity on a large scale. Furthermore, a major challenge to advancing behavioral interventions delivered by trained facilitators is assuring fidelity. We have developed a self-guided online version of the intervention that has shown feasibility and acceptability in several samples, but this version does not capture the critical social connection aspects of the facilitator-delivered intervention. We propose to take the next step toward closing the science-to- practice gap for the positive emotion regulation intervention by tailoring the self-guided online version specifically for dementia caregivers that incorporates the social connection components to combat the loneliness and isolation experienced by many Alzheimer's caregivers. The intervention, called SAGE LEAF (Social Augmentation of self-Guided Electronic delivery of the Life Enhancing Activities for Family caregivers) is in response to the National Institute on Aging's PAR-18-588 ""Assistive Technology for Person's with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and Their Caregivers."" The SAGE LEAF intervention leverages the lessons learned from the original LEAF project and adapts its positive emotion intervention to AD caregivers in a self-guided format while incorporating social connection components and adaptive system feedback mechanisms to promote intervention adherence.",R43,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9848422,R43AG065080,R43AG065080-01,65080,,,2019,1,1940,Josh,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2883,Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications,"In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project we present EyeArt, a retinal image analysis tool for automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) screenings with high diag- nostic efficacy. With its interface to EyePACS, a license-free, scalable telemedicine plat- form, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye-care providers. Research suggests that the Latino population in general are genetically predisposed to develop diabetes. Their vulnerability to vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is further compounded by factors such as lack of access to ophthalmology clinicians, lack of insurance, and lack of education. According to the Department of Health Services (DHS) in Los Angeles County (LAC) the situation for diabetics is particularly grim, with current wait times upwards of 6-9 months for retinal examinations for retinopathy screening. This can lead to treatment delays and progression towards irreversible vision loss. To help reduce risk of vision loss in this diabetic population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritizatin of ophthalmologist appointments, and aid in triage of high-risk patients. Our phase I prototype automatic DR screening tool has already shown great potential by beating current academic and commercial DR screening ap- proaches on large public retinal datasets. Going forward, we will build on our approach and further develop innovative, customized algorithms for critical low-level image processing steps, while leveraging on recent advances in computer vision, and machine learning areas for high-level, inference steps to produce a clinical grade DR screening tool. Our lesion localization and screening engine will be functionally integrated with EyePACS to further drive the expansion of screening, particularly benefiting under- resourced screening programs like the LAC-DHS safety net and its large Hispanic diabetic population.",R44,EB,NIBIB,EB,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8891422,R44EB013585,R44EB013585-04,13585,,,2015,4,1942,Pablo,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
2886,A Digital Intervention to Improve the Sexual and Reproductive Health of Male Adolescent Emergency Department Patients.,"Emergency Departments (EDs) care for 19 million adolescents each year, the majority of whom are low-income, racial and ethnic minorities, and participating in risky sexual behaviors. Despite a growing interest in expanding the role of the ED to provide preventive care, ED providers identify limited resources and time constraints as barriers to the implementation of public health interventions. Novel interventions are needed that fit efficiently within the ED workflow. Our prior work highlighted a significant public health problem-high risk sex among the adolescent male ED population. We demonstrated that adolescent male ED patients are frequently having sex without condoms, increasing their risk of unintended early fatherhood and sexually transmitted infections (STI). They admit to low knowledge of effective contraceptive methods and having few discussions with medical providers and sexual partners about these methods. However, these male adolescents are receptive to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) interventions, particularly during the ED visit and via digital technology. They are particularly interested in interventions that feel relatable and are from a trustworthy source. To date, no intervention has successfully increased contraceptive use among this high risk, hard-to-reach ED population. Additionally, although evidence suggests that SRH digital interventions can improve SRH health, few interventions specifically target males. To improve adolescent SRH outcomes, we have gathered an accomplished team with expertise in adolescent health, ED-based clinical trials, mobile health, and user- informed digital interventions. We created a novel prototype of an ED-based, theory-based, user-informed SRH digital intervention that includes a tailored educational app and 3 months of personalized and interactive text messaging. The objective of this proposal is to complete rigorous development of the intervention and perform an initial ED evaluation. In Aim #1, we will conduct usability testing and finalize development of the adolescent male-focused SRH digital intervention (entitled ERIC-Emergency Room Interventions to improve Care). In Aim #2, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of ERIC to assess implementation outcomes and potential effectiveness. We hypothesize that the ERIC intervention will be feasible in the ED setting, be acceptable to adolescent males, demonstrate fidelity, and be adopted by users. We also hypothesize that sexually active adolescent male ED patients who receive ERIC will more often have consistent condom use than those who receive standard outpatient referral alone. These data will inform a subsequent multi-center clinical trial with sufficient power to measure clinically significant changes in consistent condom use. Ultimately, a digital ED- based intervention that is effective and automated can be utilized by other EDs as a reproducible and scalable means to promote sexual and reproductive preventive care, decrease unintended early fatherhood and STI risk among adolescent males, and improve adolescent health outcomes throughout the United States.",R21,NR,NINR,NR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9958045,R21NR019181,R21NR019181-01,19181,,,2020,1,1945,Audie,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
2895,Improving Rural Population Health through Air Quality and Cardiovascular Health Education,"Children growing up in rural and medically underserved communities face unique challenges, and may not always have easy access to educational opportunities that provide experiences with cultivating biomedical knowledge and interest in scientific careers. To address this issue, we are proposing to expand upon an inquiry-based science education program called the Clean Air and Healthy Homes Program (CAHHP). Through four Aims, we will leverage our network of 50 teachers in 31 schools located in rural and American Indian / Alaska Native communities throughout Montana, Idaho, and Alaska. With an evaluation plan consisting of a mixed method design, we will test the overall hypothesis that CAHHP, with a new focus on PM2.5, cardiovascular and population health, can be successfully utilized in rural, underserved areas to increase middle/high students' interest in careers in basic and clinical medical research. We will test this hypothesis with the following Aims: Aim 1) Citizen Science: Develop authentic research experiences using novel PM2.5 and heart rate monitors with a new focus on cardiovascular/population health; Aim 2) Science communication: Build student skills, confidence and interest in science by providing opportunities for students to translate their research findings to different audiences; Aim 3) Student mentoring: Provide engagement and mentoring activities that support student research and expose students to careers in basic and clinical medical research; and Aim 4) Teacher Professional Development: Provide multiple learning opportunities for teachers and pre- service teachers in order to facilitate their understanding of biomedical concepts and their successful implementation of the CAHHP model with students.

2912,Mapping the sociotechnical ecosystem of precision medicine,"Large-scale investment in precision medicine incentivized by the 21st Century Cures Act, as well as other rapidly growing data networks of networks such as ORIEN and APOLLO connect health systems, industry partners, and researchers to the genomic, physiologic, diagnostic, treatment, research, and mobile health data of millions of individuals. Precision medicine is a sociotechnical learning health system, defined by dynamic, collaborative relationships between people, processes, policy and technology in complex environments. In sociotechnical systems, both technology and social settings mutually co-construct one another, so while technology is often a critical component of what constitutes a complex system in healthcare, just as important are the social commitments to integrate standards and usage into practice. For example, academic medical centers are adopting precision medicine methods and technologies and are making decisions based on whether their goal is to increase capacity for quick and efficient clinical management, investigational trials, or large-scale basic research. Local goals shape subsequent choices about what to sequence (whole genome, targeted panels, or whole exome), how to sequence (library preparation methods, platform, manufacturer), and logistics (speed, volume). These choices, in turn, have implications for people working in the field, the cooperative processes they engage, the policies they follow, and downstream technological developments. The cutting-edge science driving precision medicine requires infrastructure of learning health systems at multiple scales (individual, clinic/lab, organization, and societal) to transform big data to knowledge (e.g. BD2K), move new knowledge into practice and evaluate subsequent health outcomes. Nearly 80% of precision medicine programs are focused on cancer, with 35% of precision medicine programs being run at academic medical centers. The proposed research will capture this experience by examining the sociotechnical ecosystem of learning in precision oncology programs at five academic medical centers at public universities enabling a network of networks, cross-systems analysis to identify gaps that can be addressed by policies or practices. The proposed project will map the sociotechnical of learning ecosystem for precision oncology by identifying the actors (people, organizations), technologies, processes, and policies that are operating across the learning cycle (data collection, analysis, knowledge generation, outcome evaluation) and functioning at multiple scales (individual, group (clinic/lab), organizational, and societal) in five precision health practice sites nationwide (Aim 1). We will then conduct an iterative design process to develop a sociotechnical maturity model for precision oncology, adapting an informatics approach to describing the progression and developmental milestones of systems to include the social aspects that are often considered separate from the technical (Aim 2).

2917,1-D Titania Nanostructure Based Wearable Alcohol Sensor with Tunable Sensitivity and Artificial Intelligence,"The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop an artificially intelligent alcohol sensor that is wearable, non- invasive, smart, and aesthetic. The aim, in Phase I, is to design and develop the alcohol sensor based on metal (i.e., Cobalt) functionalized Titanium nanotubes (TiNT) to detect, monitor, and display blood alcohol levels in real-time using microcontrollers-based wrist-band like devices. At the core of our innovation, we have Cobalt- functionalized TiNT sensors which are capable of detecting alcohol exposure from the skin in 1ppm level that can be tuned down to 1ppb level as well (i.e., sensitivity of the sensor is tunable). The control unit of our system is reusable, sensors are replaceable, the microcontrollers are equipped with a micro-SD card for personal-data storage, and the proposed unit has a built-in wireless system for data transmission. This proposal also aims, in Phase II, to create an integrated artificially intelligent (AI) network that will have the capabilities of (a) translating the real-time data into a pre-cautious safety signals that will communicate with the personal vehicle safety features through a wireless signal (i.e., Bluetooth), and (c) adaptively taking unattended decisions-on-demand (DoD) through machine learning when the driver is heavily intoxicated. 1",R43,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9679136,R43AA027408,R43AA027408-01,27408,,,2018,1,1976,Audie,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
2918,Community I-STAR Mozambique: Community Implementation of SBIRT using Technology for Alcohol use Reduction in Mozambique,"Hazardous drinking (HD) is a major public health burden worldwide with significant morbidity and mortality. The prevention and treatment gap associated with this global burden requires that efficacious interventions be scaled-up, leveraging existing platforms and participation of policy makers ready to apply and sustain evidence-informed policies over time. To reduce HD, the WHO recommends using Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) and the mental health Gap Action Programme guidelines (mhGAP). As low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) embrace SBIRT and mhGAP for community-based HD services (HDS), a main scale-up challenge is ensuring effectiveness, fidelity, and sustainability of services. Mobile health technology (mHealth), such as the mSBIRT app developed by members of our team, is a promising tool for widespread cost-effective delivery of evidence-based HDS by community health workers (CHWs) because of its potential to increase fidelity, effectiveness, and sustainability. The proposed project, Community I-STAR (Implementation of SBIRT using Technology for Alcohol use Reduction) Mozambique, will leverage the following existing Mozambique Ministry of Health (MoH) programs: (1) a task-shifting strategy training psychiatric technicians (PsyTs) to use the mhGAP; (2) the WHO-funded epilepsy community program delivered by CHWs; and (3) an mHealth program for malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea (inSCALE - Innovations at Scale for Community Access and Lasting Effects). These currently operating programs set the stage for the use of mSBIRT by CHWs to deliver community HDS in Mozambique and generate policy for scale-up of government-funded community HDS harnessing existing human resources. Community I-STAR Mozambique comprises three phases: 1) mSBIRT adaptation, 2) a cluster-randomized trial, and 3) scale-up of the most cost-effective intervention. After a formative phase to adapt mSBIRT to Mozambique's context/culture, we will conduct a 2- year, cluster-randomized, hybrid effectiveness-implementation type 2 trial in 12 districts: 6 districts randomized to receive mSBIRT and 6 to an SBIRT Conventional Training and Supervision strategy (SBIRT-CTS), with both arms delivered by CHWs. The arm showing higher cost-effectiveness in the 2-year trial will be scaled up to the other 6 districts for 12 ""cross-over"" months. Throughout the trial and the ""cross-over"" scale-up, qualitative and process data will complement quantitative assessments to examine implementation, sustainability, and scale-up. Our approach redefines work roles without requiring new human resources, and it comports with the MoH's commitment to implementing HDS. We will use evidence-based practices (SBIRT) to a) build capacity for complete task-shifting of sustainable community-HDS practices; and b) use implementation tools to examine implementation and effectiveness of two SBIRT delivery strategies followed by evaluation of scale-up of the most cost-effective strategy. Community I-STAR Mozambique will scale-up a cost-effective, sustainable program and inform policy applicable to Mozambique and other LMICs.",R01,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9661898,R01AA025947,R01AA025947-01A1,25947,A1,,2018,1,1977,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
2919,PRS Center for Admixed Populations and Health Equity (CAPE),"Polygenic risk scores (PRS), that aggregate risk across common variants in the genome, have emerged as a powerful tool towards implementing genomic medicine. Unfortunately, the vast majority of genomic data from which current PRS are estimated is coming from European ancestry individuals thus prohibiting the implementation of PRS for non-European individuals. To address this gap, multiple large-scale genomic studies are currently performed in non-European individuals. Of particular interest are individuals with recent ancestry from multiple continental sources such as African Americans and/or Hispanic Americans whose genomes are a mosaic of segments of various ancestries. Such diversity in genetic ancestry raises unique challenges in the equitable PRS development as the accuracy and bias of existing PRS varies across genomic ancestries. Unlike existing paradigm that largely views genetic ancestry as a confounder in PRS studies, we aim to fully integrate population genetics of the admixture process to yield admixture-PRS that provide equitable accuracies for all individuals irrespective of genetic ancestries. We will integrate data of over 230,000 admixed individuals across five diverse medical systems including UCLA, Mt Sinai, Colorado to develop, calibrate and benchmark PRS for admixed individuals.",U01,HG,NHGRI,HG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10212827,U01HG011715,U01HG011715-01,11715,,,2021,1,1978,Audie,,,,,,,,,
2922,Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations,"One in five adults in the U.S. are thought to be living with a disability, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting physical movement patterns. Medical care costs related to disability in the US exceed $300 billion annually. Regular physical activity (PA) represents an important modifiable behavior to improve the overall health of these disabled groups and to realize their movement potential. Substantial progress has been made in developing and testing wearable monitor calibrations to predict physical activity (PA) level and type. However, little scientific attention has been given to develop methods to assess PA in disabled populations. The aims of this application focus on filling this scientific knowledge gap. Specific Aim 1) To measure impairment and function to provide a movement disorder analysis of: a) no movement limitation; b) upper extremity limitation; c) lower extremity limitation, or d) both upper and lower extremity limitation. Specific Aim 2) To measure bilateral wrist, hip, and ankle acceleration to conditionally model metabolic cost and activity type estimates. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by first carrying out a multitude of advanced upper and lower body strength, coordination, and functional motor tasks to isolate key impairment and function limitations across a diverse population with movement pattern differences. Then using an unsupervised learning and cluster analysis approach we will use these data to evaluate a fast, convenient, and simple metric to categorize functional movement pattern differences. We will assess criterion energy cost and multiple hip and limb acceleration during an extensive battery of activities of daily living, to guide the development of single or combined wearable motion sensor algorithms across categories of functional movement groups using advanced analytical techniques. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to both categorize and assess PA in persons with movement limitations. This will present the foundation to evaluate a decision-tree approach to guide both monitor placement and algorithm choice to assess PA in diverse populations. Ultimately, our work will provide the potential to precisely and accurately assess PA prevalence rates, effectiveness of behavior-based PA interventions, and PA dose-response relationships to prevent and manage disabling conditions.",R21,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8891470,R21HD080828,R21HD080828-02,80828,,,2015,2,1981,Leonie,,,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
2926,MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing.,"As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not re- ceive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitali- zations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self- report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and as- sessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mo- bile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. com- munication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, pri- mary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression man- agement (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy, social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, par- ents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care.",R44,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9908603,R44MH122067,R44MH122067-01,122067,,,2019,1,1985,Leonie,,,,,,,,,

2958,Smartphone Medication Adherence Stops Hypertension (SMASH) Among Hispanics,"Uncontrolled essential hypertension (EH) is a major risk factor for stroke, renal failure and cardiovascular events. Hispanics have the highest rate of uncontrolled EH (BP e 140/90 mmHg) in the U.S. Two primary responsible factors are patient medication non-adherence and clinician failure to intensify therapy in timely manners (i.e., therapeutic inertia). BP control programs are needed which can be sustained by EHs and readily disseminated by healthcare providers. There have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating theory driven culturally tailored mobile health technology applications among Hispanics with uncontrolled EH. In response to PA-12-023, the proposed R21 research proposal will test and refine the Smart phone Medication Adherence Stops Hypertension (SMASH) program. SMASH includes multi-level components: 1) automated reminders from an electronic medication tray; 2) tailored text message/voice mail motivational feedback and reinforcement based upon adherence to daily medication and BP monitoring; 3) automated summary reports and direct alerts to providers and 4) booster program for SMASHers who show deterioration in BP control and/or medication adherence after the 3 month trial. The aims are as follows: Aim 1a: Conduct 3 month 2 arm (SMASH vs. enhanced Standard Care [SC]) feasibility RCT with 6 month follow up in 60 uncontrolled EH 21-55 year old Hispanics. Primary feasibility outcomes are measures of recruitment and retention rates, intervention use and patient and provider satisfaction, and Aim 1b: Obtain estimates of variability of changes in primary outcomes of BP changes (i.e. % reaching JN7 designated BP control: resting BP <140/90 mmHg). Other BP measures include: % reaching 24-hour BP control: < 130/80 mmHg) and absolute reductions in resting and 24-hour BP at 3, 6, and 9 months. Secondary outcomes: patient adherence (med intake, BP self-monitoring), self-determination theory constructs of self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation (i.e., autonomous regulation) and provider adherence to JNC7 guidelines (timing of med changes). Aim 2. Conduct focus groups after 6 month final follow-up with providers and staff (n=6-10) and random sample of SMASHers (n=16) to assess key user reactions including perceived cultural sensitivity, acceptability, usability, salience & sustainability facilitators/barriers. Aim 3. Triangulate data from Aims 1 and 2 to further refine and optimize SMASH and prepare for a full-scale efficacy/effectiveness RCT (PA-12-022, R01). Long-term objective is to develop practical, effective and sustainable mHealth primary and secondary prevention programs for EH and CVD.

2966,Developing a Mobile App-Based Intervention to Promote Cognitive Health in Older Chinese Americans,"Older Chinese Americans are one of the fastest growing populations in the United States, who face many social and economic barriers. Over 70% of older Chinese Americans are first generation immigrants, nearly 20% are living below the poverty line (9% in general US older adults), and close to half of them have limited English proficiency. These socioeconomic disadvantages shared by older Chinese Americans will not only contribute to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), but also inequitable access to effective strategies to promote cognitive health. Cognitive training is one of the few interventions shown to be beneficial to the maintenance or enhancement of cognitive function in older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. The widespread use of mobile phones offers an unprecedented opportunity to deliver cognitive training interventions remotely to a large population at relatively low cost. This is particularly relevant to the immigrant populations as they often reside in ethnic enclaves and rely heavily on smartphones and apps to build social networks and to access local services. Despite the promise of mobile app-based cognitive training, most prior interventions were tested exclusively in non-Hispanic Whites. Currently, no tailored cognitive training program exists that can accommodate the unique immigration history, cultural values, and linguistic properties of older Chinese Americans. To address this gap, we aim to develop a mHealth intervention for cognitive training that is culturally and linguistically relevant to older Chinese Americans. We will leverage our strong partnership with a local Chinese community organization, industry partner, and interdisciplinary expertise in cognitive aging, ethnogeriatrics, implementation science, and experience-based codesign. More specifically, the proposed aims are: Aim 1: To adapt empirically supported cognitive training components into a culturally and linguistically relevant cognitive training intervention protocol. Aim 2: To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the proposed cognitive training intervention to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and obtain preliminary effect sizes on outcomes including global cognition (primary), mental health, physical functioning, and quality of life. This study will provide the scientific groundwork for a multi-site large scale randomized control trial to test the real-world efficacy of this cognitive training intervention. In addition, this project will further our knowledge of methods to support engagement of ethnic minority communities in clinical research studies. Taken together, these efforts are expected to ultimately facilitate the implementation of effective, sustainable, and scalable mHealth interventions to promoting cognitive aging specifically suited for ethnic minority older adults.",R21,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10352286,R21AG075228,R21AG075228-01,75228,,,2022,1,2026,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
2968,Early Neurobehavioral Marker of Anxiety: Linking Threat Bias & Real World Emotion,"Childhood anxiety is one of the most prevalent, common, and costly psychiatric disorders, with economic costs in the US estimated at over 40 billion USD per year. [15] As such, there is a critical need for earlier, more accurate diagnoses of pediatric anxiety disorders. Research has implicated threat bias, defined as preferential attention to threat, in the etiology of anxiety disorders. [1] However, it is unclear whether clinically-significant anxiety in young children is signaled by early (i.e., increased orienting to threat) or late (i.e., difficulty disengaging from threat) components of threat bias, or both. Determining the extent to which early or late threat bias components serve as reliable neurobehavioral markers of anxiety disorders in the early school- aged years -- a developmental period when rates of anxiety disorders begin to rise -- could reduce the public health and private burden of this illness. Specifically, this information could: (a) improve assessment protocols for differentiating between normative vs. clinical levels of anxiety, (b) elucidate altered attention control as a risk mechanism that could be directly targeted in treatment, (c) identify disruptions in a RDoC construct, ""response to threat"" systems, that are relevant for understanding the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders, and (d) determine underlying causes of maladaptive real-world responses to threat, which would in turn, (e) improve clinical efforts aimed at preventing the negative squeal of childhood-onset anxiety disorders. Thus, the candidate's immediate focus is to investigate altered attention control as a potential neurobehavioral marker of clinically-significant anxiety in young school-aged children. Using an affective variant of a spatil cueing paradigm (Posner task), behavioral and electro cortical indices of threat bias will be assessed in a sample of anxious (N = 60) and non-anxious (N = 30) young children, aged 6-9 years. Children with specific phobia, social phobia, and separation anxiety disorders will be recruited for the anxious sample and enrollment will be monitored to ensure that at least 30 anxious children meet criteria for a moderate-to- severe impairment. Aim 1 will determine the extent to which the late component of threat bias differentiates between children with and without anxiety. To further determine the clinical significance of early and late threat bias indics for pediatric anxiety disorders, Aim 2.1 will examine relations between magnitude of early vs. late threat bias components and severity of parent-rated symptoms. Using experience sampling method (ESM) and a device called the Electronically-Activated Recorder (EAR), Aim 2.2 will determine the real-world significance of alterations in anxious children's attention responses to threat by modeling relations between indices of early and late threat bias and real-world indices of altered ER, specifically level of negative affect, sustained focus on negative events (worry, rumination), and ability to use regulatory strategies that require attention control (cognitive restructuring, distraction). To appropriately test these Aims and to develop as an independent neurobehavioral scientist, the candidate seeks to build on her strong foundation in developmental psychopathology and early childhood emotion regulation (ER) with advanced training in: 1) developmental cognitive affective neuroscience approaches for understanding typical and atypical ER, particularly in relation to developing affective circuitry and the pathophysiology of anxiety, 2) designing, adapting, and implementing EEG/ERP methods to assess threat processing in young children, with an emphasis on paradigms and analytic methods that leverage the temporal sensitivity of EEG for identifying anxiety-related disruptions in cognitive control processes that unfold as children process and respond to emotional information, 3) ecologically-sensitive methods for assessing real- world ER behaviors in young clinical populations, and 4) statistical tools for integrating brain-behavior time series data and or modeling the temporal features of ER processes. The University Of Pittsburgh School Of Medicine is an outstanding environment in which to engage in the interdisciplinary training required to achieve these goals. The candidate's mentorship team has extensive experience in developmental cognitive affective neuroscience (Drs. Siegle, Ladouceur, Pine, and Silk), innovation of novel ecologically-sensitive methods for assessing clinically-relevant child behaviors (Drs. Silk and Slatcher), utilization of EEG/ERP methods to investigate cognitive control processes in pediatric clinical populations (Drs. Ladouceur and Fox), assessment and diagnosis of pediatric anxiety disorders (Dr. Sakolsky), and advanced statistical tools for time series data (Drs. Lanza and Siegle). The proposed study is a first step in establishing the extent to which early vs. late threat bias components signifies clinically-significant anxiety in younger children. Findings will inform the design of larger R01 studies examining altered attention control as 1) a possible neurocognitive risk mechanism for differentiating risk among emotional disorders and anxiety subtypes, 2) a mediator of anxiety-related developmental trajectories, or 3) a target for change in the early intervention and prevention of pediatric anxiety disorders. In sum, the proposed K01 application would position the candidate for an innovative research career that integrates developmental, cognitive and affective neuroscience approaches to uncover the associations between brain and real-world behavior that underpin anxiety-related trajectories.",K01,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8822926,K01MH100261,K01MH100261-03,100261,,,2015,3,2028,Josh,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

The STEMI community will develop, evaluate the efficacy of and broadly disseminate high school learning products that address these issues. UMMC faculty in bioscience, anthropology, quantitative and qualitative data analysis, and program evaluation will guide high school science teachers from schools representative of the state's diversity of experiences and resources in new technological approaches with which to engage students in exploration of causal relationships among low health literacy, obesity, and ensuing anatomic and functional pathophysiology. STEMI will engage teachers in flipped learning/classroom (FL/C) science instruction, providing them with the tools to deliver to students' novel learning modules aligned with Next Generation Science Standards that specifically address CVD concerns directly impacted by nutrition and obesity. A UMMC anthropologist will facilitate networked approaches for creative teaching of social determinants of health, their impact on health disparities, and CVD. Summative, multisite, telecast presentations will also be created to broadly introduce school communities, peers and families to the STEMI Community of Health Learners. Four cadres of teachers will be guided through 2-year cycles of CVD-themed, didactic summer and weekend training aimed at: 1) design of FL/C explorations of obesity and health; 2) incorporation of classroom technology tools; and 3) electronic facilitation of interactive presentations on obesity, health literacy and CVD across school sites.

2992,A New Paradigm for Treating Functional Abdominal Pain Disorders in Children,"John M. Hollier, MD, a board-certified pediatric gastroenterologist, is an Assistant Professor at Baylor College of Medicine who seeks to obtain essential skills and mentored research experience for an independent career as a pediatric clinical researcher utilizing health technologies. Many aspects of medicine are affected by poor medication adherence, ill-advised health behaviors, and poor access to medical care. The candidate's career goal is to conquer these barriers by harnessing the potential of current (e.g., mobile) and future technologies as tools to fulfill these endeavors. Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) affect up to 20% of school-age children (and adults) worldwide and are associated with significant morbidity and health care costs. Up to 60% of children with FAPDs go on to have similar conditions as adults. Many affected children suffer from psychosocial distress like anxiety and depression. The most effective treatment for these disorders (psychological interventions) remains out of reach for most children with FAPDs. The applicant proposes to refine his innovative mobile application (App) prototype designed to remotely deliver audio- recorded guided imagery therapy (ARGIT App) for pediatric patients with FAPDs using accepted technology development techniques. Specific Aims: 1) Refine our ARGIT App prototype's design, operation, and GIT session content via patient, caregiver, and expert stakeholders' feedback by using qualitative interviews 2) Conduct a double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing GIT versus deep breathing exercises (control) utilizing the refined ARGIT App over 8 weeks in children with FAPDs to assess the efficacy of guided imagery therapy and evaluate whether psychosocial distress is altered as a result of this intervention over time. 3) Assess acceptability of the refined ARGIT App among affected children and their caregivers through qualitative interviews. Dr. Hollier has assembled a multidisciplinary team of esteemed NIH-funded mentors and collaborators with a diverse range of expertise in mobile health App development, clinical trial methodology, qualitative research methods, and health behavior change specialists.

2993,Racial Disparities in Pain Care: A Comprehensive Integration of Patient- and Provider-Level Mechanisms with Dyadic Communication Processes Using a Mixed-Methods Research Design,"Despite decades of efforts to reduce racial pain disparities, the pain of Black patients is still undertreated. As persistent pain experience robustly predicts poorer quality of life overall, racial pain care disparities represent a central factor fueling larger social inequalities. While previous work has identified a host of patient and provider factors that contribute to racial disparities in healthcare in general and thus also likely contributing to disparities in pain care, there has been limited clinically-meaningful progress in eliminating these disparities. Thus, there is an urgent need to address this decades-old inequity by taking an innovative approach. We argue that this lack of progress is due to the fact that prior research has investigated the influence of patient and provider factors in isolation, rather than examining their interaction. Successful pain care requires constructive patient-provider communication, and constructive communication is both dyadic and dynamic. This proposed research will establish the dyadic and dynamic processes underlying patient-provider communication as the key mechanism through which patient and provider factors contribute to racial disparities in both patient- centered and clinical pain outcomes. One well-accepted operationalization of such dyadic processes is behavioral coordination (i.e., spatial/temporal matching in the rhythms or patterns of behaviors between individuals engaged in an interaction, such as synchrony, leader-and-follower dynamics, and turn-taking). We hypothesize that the pain of Black patients continues to be undertreated because Black (vs. White) patients are more likely to participate in racially discordant medical interactions (i.e., seeing other-race providers) and as a result, are more likely to experience disruptions in behavioral coordination. These hypotheses will be tested within the context of preoperative consultations because racial disparities in surgical pain outcomes are well- documented across procedures, and further, the quality of preoperative consultations is linked to post-surgical pain management. We will use a convergent mixed methods research design to assess behavioral coordination quantitatively (e.g., levels, duration, patterns) and qualitatively (e.g., valence, discussion themes). This work will: Aim 1) compare the levels, duration, patterns, and context of behavioral coordination in preoperative consultations (both overall and during pain discussion specifically) between Black and White patients; Aim 2) elucidate links between patient/provider factors and coordination in preoperative consultations; and Aim 3) identify specific aspects of behavioral coordination in preoperative consultations that contribute to racial disparities in post-surgical patient-centered outcomes (e.g., pain management self-efficacy, quality of life) and clinical outcomes (e.g., pain level, prescriptions). Since this research focuses on pain management self-efficacy and quality of life as primary outcomes, findings will be generalizable beyond surgical pain. The proposed work will lay the foundation for developing interventions that target modifiable factors (the dyadic processes underlying patient-provider communication) that can be addressed by leveraging existing infrastructure (medical training).",R01,NR,NINR,NR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10446762,R01NR020030,R01NR020030-01A1,20030,A1,,2022,1,2055,Audie,,,,,,,,,
3002,Precision Medicine for All,"The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference will continually coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The format of the conference series will differ depending on the year's chosen topics with input from previous attendees. Most conferences will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for those topics. Other conferences as part of this series will include both invited speakers as well as hands-on workshops led by invited workshop leaders to address specific training needs applicable to precision medicine research voiced by previous and future conference attendees. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we will consider women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the undergraduate and trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine will be a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest over the next five years.",R13,HG,NHGRI,HG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9260316,R13HG009481,R13HG009481-01,9481,,,2016,1,2064,Josh,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
3005,Implementation of support tools to promote safety in the prescribing of oral contraceptives,"Nearly half of the pregnancies in the United States are unintended despite the discovery of the first combination hormonal contraceptive in the 1960s. Hormonal contraceptives are an efficacious and cost-effective strategy to decrease the rate of unintended pregnancy. Lack of access to contraceptive services, especially for adolescents, minority women, and women of lower socioeconomic status creates significant health and financial inequities and leads to significant US government expenditures. Pharmacist-prescribed contraceptive services have the potential to increase access to care, decreasing the number of unintended pregnancies in the US. Pharmacists have expressed interest in providing contraceptive services but have cited several barriers that currently serve to hinder their expansion. For the widespread growth of pharmacist-prescribed contraceptive services, an implementation package is needed that addresses the barriers that currently exist. A contraceptive-specific Electronic Health Record system that increases efficiency, incorporates point-of-care tools, and is affordable will be the foundation of a successful implementation package. OvaryIt, a Florida-based small business, has developed a proprietary HIPAA-compliant contraceptive-specific platform for the provision of direct-to-consumer telehealth services. We propose to adapt this platform to serve as the foundation of a comprehensive implementation package to expand in-person pharmacist-prescribed contraceptive services. Phase I will support studies to investigate the feasibility and establish a proof-of-concept of such a solution. Aim 1: Conduct a needs assessment to determine operational requirements. This will result in project documentation and the roadmap needed to integrate contraceptive functionality within existing Pharmacy Management Systems. Aim 2: Completion of a study of 20 pharmacist end-users comparing the OvaryIt platform to the current standard paper charting process. Each pharmacist will complete two standardized contraceptive patient encounters, one utilizing each process. Outcomes will include time to completion of the encounter, compliance with the USMEC guidelines, appropriate prescription selection, and quantitative survey data. Aim 3: Conduct a focus group with pharmacist end-users and administrative stakeholders to discuss the perceived strength and quality of the proposed project solutions for each of the identified barriers or pain points to implementation success. At the end of Phase I, OvaryIt, LLC will have a roadmap for a comprehensive implementation package with vetted solutions for the many barriers that currently prevent the adoption of pharmacist-prescribed contraceptive services. Phase II efforts will allow for the creation of a comprehensive implementation package ready for widespread commercialization to independent, large chain, and health system-based pharmacies. A tremendous market opportunity exists for OvaryIt, LLC and participating pharmacies to create new revenue opportunities while significantly expanding access to contraceptives in the US.",R43,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10547335,R43HD110346,R43HD110346-01,110346,,,2022,1,2068,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
3014,Miami Regional Coordinating Center for NINDS Stroke Trials Network,"This proposal outlines the University of Miami's application to become a Regional Coordinating Center (RCC) in the Stroke Trials Network. The goals of the Miami RCC are to: a) provide a robust and efficient infrastructure to implement high-quality research clinical trials that address acute stroke treatment, prevention and recovery; b) leverage the internal and regional resources to enhance the Stroke Trials Network; c) train the next generation of stroke clinical and translational researchers. The Miami RCC encompasses a large network of participating acute care, rehabilitation and pediatric hospitals that span South Florida, the largest metropolitan area in the Southeast, to ensure robust enrollment of an ethnically diverse, predominantly Hispanic, population that reflects the changing demographics of the US. Our stroke program has a successful track record of participating in numerous NINDS acute and secondary prevention stroke trials, and is involved in other networks (Neuro-NEXT, SPIRP). Through our Comprehensive Stroke Center, extended referral network and multidisciplinary expertise, we will build upon the close partnership with pre-hospital Emergency Services, Emergency Medicine, Vascular Neurosurgery, Interventional Neurology, Neuro-Critical Care, Pediatric Neurology and Neurorehabilitation, as well as on academic-private institutional collaborations, to enroll and manage potential study participants. We also have unique resources that we can bring to the network. Integrated collaboration among cutting edge researchers in the areas of preclinical stroke, stem cells, human genomics, biorepository, brain bank, and the Miami CTSI make us uniquely positioned to develop, propose and implement novel translational early phase projects. The large residency and fellowship training programs in Neurology, the multidisciplinary educational resources in the institution, and our track record of instructing clinical researchers position our center to effectively train strok researchers in clinical and translational research through a structured mentored program. Therefore, we have the depth and breadth of expertise and resources to successfully function as a RCC in the Stroke Trials Network.",U10,NS,NINDS,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8895095,U10NS086528,U10NS086528-03,86528,,,2015,3,2077,Tom,,,,,,,,,
3018,Proof of concept study to treat negative affect in chronic low back pain,"This proposal responds to RFA-NS-19-029 to address the need for better evidence-based pain treatment for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) who have co-occurring negative affective disorders, such as major depression with anxious features. The CLBP subgroup with comorbid depression or anxiety disorders (commonly termed, high negative affect) is approximately 20-30% of the 50 million adults with CLBP in this country. This subgroup is particularly refractory to pain treatment and is in desperate need of better non- opioid, comprehensive pain treatment options. Patients with CLBP and high levels of negative affect (NA) suffer higher levels of pain and have worse disability and function. Due to these factors they are prescribed opioids more frequently and misuse opioids at a much greater rate (40-60% rates of non-adherence), which is related to self-medication of depression and anxiety by taking extra opioids. Poor pain management in patients with high NA is due in part to a lack of more effective evidenced-based treatment options to improve pain, depression, anxiety, and function, and prevent opioid misuse. We have shown in separate RCTs in CLBP patients with high NA that antidepressants (AD) or ""fear avoidance based physical therapy"" improve pain, function, depression, and anxiety. In this proposal we will also present data showing that the combination of antidepressants + fear avoidance PT is more efficacious than each treatment alone or a control condition. Moreover, we have also tested an enhanced fear avoidance rehabilitation protocol (EFAR) to improve outcomes further, and we found it more effective than usual care. To address the unmet needs of CLBP patients with high negative affect, we propose to test in a randomized trial if the combination of AD+EFAR is more effective than each treatment alone to improve pain, function, depression, and prevent opioid misuse (3- arms, in 300 subjects). To better identify responders to components of the intervention (AD or EFAR), we will use an adaptive design whereby non-responders to each treatment are re-randomized to receive the other treatment. This multimodal, combination approach of pharmacotherapy +behavioral therapy is novel to the field and has the potential to shift current treatment paradigms. We will also show that the community practice environment is poised to make this shift rapidly as well. The primary outcomes are a measure of combined clinically meaningful changes in pain and self-reported function (Combined Response), and the rate of 50% improvement in depression symptoms (Depression Response) at 4 months vs. baseline. We track outcomes for a total of 8 months. The main secondary outcome is the proportion of drug misuse in each treatment group. Additional secondary outcomes include changes in sleep quality, activity levels, anxiety, craving, and opioid dose. Our anticipated findings will provide high quality evidence supporting the combined use of AD+EFAR in the prevalent group of CLBP patients with high NA. We will also identify which phenotypic subgroups of patients may best respond to just AD or EFAR alone.",UG3,AR,NIAMS,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9881969,UG3AR076568,UG3AR076568-01,76568,,,2019,1,2081,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
3037,Developing an mHealth Intervention that Leverages Social Networks to Improve ART Adherence among HIV-Infected Adolescents in South Africa,"The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Mulawa with the training and mentorship to become an independent behavioral scientist focused on the development and evaluation of innovative multi-level interventions that reduce AIDS-related morbidity and mortality in resource- limited settings. The objective of the proposed research is to identify social network-level factors associated with adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among perinatally HIV-infected adolescents in Cape Town, South Africa, and to use this information to develop and pilot test a mobile health (mHealth) intervention to promote ART adherence by engaging the social networks of this population. This K01 will provide the necessary support for Dr. Mulawa to achieve the following scientific training objectives: (1) obtain investigator- level skills in the design, execution, and evaluation of clinical trials, (2) build expertise in mHealth intervention development, deployment, and evaluation, (3) enrich statistical capacities in the analysis of egocentric and longitudinal social network data, and (4) gain proficiency in adolescent-specific theories of behavior change and concepts with salience to the South African cultural context. Additional professional training objectives include expanding training in the ethical conduct of cross-cultural research in low-resource settings and building general professional development skills. To support these goals, Dr. Mulawa has a mentoring team led by Dr. Kathleen Sikkema, an expert in the development and evaluation of HIV behavioral trials in the South African context. Co-Mentors and Advisors will provide expertise in the development of HIV-related mHealth interventions for adolescents (Dr. Lisa Hightow-Weidman), the use of social network analysis to understand adolescent behaviors (Dr. James Moody), adolescent psychiatric health in South Africa (Dr. Jacqueline Hoare), as well as quantitative (Dr. Joseph Egger) and qualitative methods (Dr. Melissa Watt). Training objectives will be met through a comprehensive training plan involving one-on-one meetings, didactics/trainings, mentor- directed readings, seminars/lab meetings, and scientific meetings. Skills gained through the training plan will be put into action through the execution of a complementary research plan. The proposed study will be conducted with a cohort of perinatally HIV-infected adolescents, ages 12-14 years in Aim 1 data, enrolled in a sub-study of the Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort (CTAAC). Aim 1 is to analyze egocentric social network data from CTAAC participants (n = 100) to identify the relationship between social network-level factors (structural and functional characteristics) and ART adherence. Aim 2 is to iteratively customize an mHealth intervention that leverages social networks to promote ART adherence in this population. Aim 3 is to pilot test the mHealth intervention with 50 CTAAC adolescents to a) assess its feasibility and acceptability and b) explore preliminary effects on ART adherence and social support. The proposed study will provide data for Dr. Mulawa's first R01 proposal, to be submitted in the final year of this proposed award.",K01,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9779427,K01MH118072,K01MH118072-01A1,118072,A1,,2019,1,2102,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
3041,Western North Carolina StrokeNet,"Improving the outcomes of patients with stroke requires evaluation of new therapeutics, technology, or care models through clinical trials. A network of dedicated sites, such as StrokeNet, enables enrollment of large numbers of patients quickly and efficiently, testing effectiveness of these new treatment options faster. Wake Forest Baptist Health (WFBH) has partnered with 3 sites to develop the Western North Carolina (NC) StrokeNet. Our network includes 4 of the 6 comprehensive stroke centers in NC, the heart of the Stroke Belt: Wake Forest Baptist Health (RCC), Novant Forsyth Medical Center, Novant Presbyterian, and Mission Health. The referral and telestroke outreach of our network includes the Piedmont region and nearly all of NC west of the Piedmont, and part of southern Virginia--over 4 million individuals,16,800 square miles, and over 4,000 stroke patients admitted to these hospitals per year. We serve a diverse socioeconomic and rural catchment area, a population typically under-represented in clinical trials. WFBH has been highly successful with the design and conduct of clinical trials, including phase II, III, and pragmatic trials. WFBH's enrollment in all trials, and the combination of WFBH and Novant enrollment in NINDS sponsored trials has been outstanding. Mission and Novant Presbyterian have each participated in our pragmatic trial of post-acute services (COMPASS), each enrolling over 300 patients, and have success with enrolling in NIH and industry sponsored studies. We have experienced stroke leadership at the RCC, with Dr. Bushnell (neurology) as PI, Dr. Wolfe (vascular neurosurgery), co-PI, and Dr. Duncan (neurology), co-I, as well as a seasoned StrokeNet program manager, Ms. Sylvia Coleman, who will assist the partnering sites with trial selection, startup, and operations to meet the goals of efficiency and enrollment with StrokeNet clinical trials. The RCC team has experience in design and implementation of rehab/recovery and pragmatic trials, and development of community networks that will be beneficial to recruitment, retention, and dissemination of results-an asset to the overall StrokeNet. Our aims are: AIM 1: Successfully implement StrokeNet trials in the Piedmont Triad and Western NC and design new stroke treatment trials. AIM 2: Implement a novel approach for recruitment, retention, and ascertainment of outcomes through 2a) existing telemedicine networks for recruitment and ascertainment of outcomes; and 2b) Creating the Western NC Advocacy Committee that will include patient advocates, patients, EMS providers, and clinicians to establish best strategies for community engagement; AIM 3: Develop community outreach programs to engage rural and urban communities in our referral region in StrokeNet trials.",U24,NS,NINDS,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9571851,U24NS107235,U24NS107235-01,107235,,,2018,1,2106,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3060,Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!),"Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world. The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course. This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results. Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3).

3076,Developing and testing a mobile health intervention to promote sun protection behaviors and skin examination among Hispanics,"Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States (US). Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. In the past two decades, melanoma incidence among Hispanics has risen by 20%. The mortality rate of Hispanics is higher compared to Non-Hispanic whites (NHW). In general, compared to NHW, Hispanics diagnosed with melanoma are younger, have thicker tumors, and have worse survival rates. Skin cancer can be prevented with regular sun protection, and early detection can improve skin cancer outcomes. The Hispanic population is the fastest growing ethnic group in the US. Alarmingly, Hispanics are less aware of the symptoms and harms of skin cancers, tend to have misperceptions regarding the risks and benefits of skin cancer prevention behaviors, engage in less sun protection behaviors than NHW, and only 18% of them reported ever having done a skin self-examination. In addition, due to the increase of acculturation of Hispanics in the US, their sun-safety behaviors are poorer than non-US Hispanics. Occupational exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a risk factor for skin cancer, and Hispanic individuals are over-represented in a number of outdoor occupations. Approximately 21% of the 2018 US Hispanic workforce were employed in industries that involved significant amounts of occupational UVR exposure such as construction. Therefore, an increasing effort to raise awareness regarding sun protection and skin self-examination behaviors is needed to address the existing gap of skin cancer research among Hispanics. This research project seeks to develop a mobile-based and user-centered intervention to promote sun protection and skin self-examination among a diverse sample of Hispanics using an iterative approach to capture relevant contextual issues and evaluate the preliminary effects of the intervention. During the K99 phase, I will: 1) collect, analyze, and triangulate data from the Hispanic community and other stakeholders (e.g., health care providers and community leaders) for skin cancer digital intervention development; and 2) through a user- centered approach, develop an innovative WhatsApp intervention to promote skin cancer-related health behaviors among Hispanics to improve participants' engagement in the intervention. During the R00 phase, I will: 3) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of this mobile intervention in a pre-, post-test study among Hispanics at risk for skin cancer; and 4) refine the intervention and conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial using this mobile service among Hispanics at risk for skin cancers and assess the preliminary effects of the mobile intervention at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up. The intervention has strong potential for cost- effective, widespread dissemination and targets an understudied group at-risk for future cancer development. The training experiences and mentoring obtained during this K99/R00 project are critical foundations for a successful independent cancer research career.",K99,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10448568,K99MD016435,K99MD016435-01A1,16435,A1,,2022,1,2142,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
3077,Developing a mobile application for circadian wellness in cancer patients,"Circadian (daily) rhythms play a significant role in the efficacy and tolerability of cancer treatments in both rodents and humans. Disruption of circadian rhythms disturbs sleep and has been shown to result in poorer survivorship rates in cancer patients. Furthermore, evidence suggests that timing treatments and interventions with circadian considerations can improve outcomes. While knowledge of internal time holds much potential for the treatment of disease, measuring circadian rhythms in the lab can be time-consuming and expensive. One's typical behavior (e.g. normal wake and bed times) can provide a first-order estimate of circadian state, but individual genetic variation and disruption of the circadian clock from irregular light exposure will throw off this estimate. Light at night from screens, a particularly important factor to consider in monitoring circadian rhythms, is now more common and disruptive than ever. We have developed mobile applications for estimating circadian rhythms in a non-invasive way using mathematical models. The apps track motion and activity and use these factors to predict both light and the user's internal time in a way that accounts for disruptions to one's ""normal"" schedule. We propose to develop a mobile app for cancer patients that recommends lighting interventions to correct disrupted circadian rhythms as well as the best times for drug consumption for optimal circadian effect. We furthermore propose to integrate this system into the home environments of patients to improve compliance. The proposed work will be directed toward adapting the math models and algorithms underlying our past work into a tool for cancer patients. The outcome will be a prototype app that tracks patient circadian rhythms and suggests interventions to steer their circadian clocks back in sync with their environment, promoting health and managing insomnia. A Phase I SBIR grant would be used to develop the app and assess its potential in a limited usability trial. A Phase II SBIR would extend the work by refining the app and testing it in a clinical trial.",R43,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9558045,R43CA236557,R43CA236557-01A1,236557,A1,,2018,1,2143,Chris,,,,,,,,,
3078,Predicting Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease Acute Pain Using Mathematical Models Based on mHealth Data,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects over 20 million people living worldwide and approximately 100,000 individuals living in the United States. Individuals with SCD are at increased risk of mortality, poor health-related quality of life, and high health care utilization. Pain is the primary factor linked to poor health outcomes and increased medical costs for individuals with SCD. The majority of SCD pain episodes are unanticipated; leading to a lack of prophylactic pain management, increased use of opioids and other health care, and poor quality of life. Accurate mathematical models to predict SCD pain in pediatric patients would facilitate the development, testing, and maximizing of the timing of implementation of interventions to improve their effectiveness, and reduce the use of opioids; thus, minimizing the risk of opioid dependence. Our central hypothesis is that dynamic mathematical models that incorporate time-varying mobile health (mHealth) variables will increase the accuracy of prediction of individual daily pediatric SCD pain features - pain severity, onset, and exacerbations. We also hypothesize that changes in mHealth data are important precursors to changes in pediatric SCD pain. Our short-term goal is to develop and test a dynamic mathematical modeling framework that includes combinations of mHealth variables to identify the best model formulations for predicting individual daily pediatric SCD pain features. The proposed study will leverage existing data from a previous project focused on the relationship between sleep and SCD pain - to date, the largest study that incorporates ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and actigraphy measures for youth with SCD. The previous analyses of these data did not consider the dynamic nature of the relationships or examine the range of mHealth data available. To accomplish this goal, we aim to (1) construct a framework consisting of a dynamic mathematical model that focuses on predicting pediatric SCD pain severity that can utilize various combinations of mHealth variables, and (2) determine which modeling framework instances - mHealth data combinations coupled with the model - are effective for predicting individual SCD pain severity patterns. Then (3) we will use the framework instances selected to predict risk of pediatric SCD pain onset and pain exacerbations and determine which mHealth variable combinations are most successful at predicting these pain features. Specifically, we will apply machine learning algorithms and assess the ability of each instance of the modeling framework to predict pain onset or exacerbation the next day.",R21,DE,NIDCR,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10599401,R21DE032583,R21DE032583-01,32583,,,2022,1,2144,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
3079,EXTENDING INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE OR DEMENTIA THROUGH TELEHEALTH PROGRAM DELIVERY,"Mission Statement: Together Senior Health, Inc. (TOGETHER), is committed to helping people living with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) and their caregivers maximize quality of life by delivering livestreaming, evidence-based, virtual group programs to them in their homes. Significance: There are currently 5.8 million people in the U.S. living with ADRD and more than 16 million unpaid caregivers. Current ADRD medications help with some symptoms but do not change the disease course and are often stopped due to side effects. In addition, most evidence-based behavioral interventions-such as our in-person Moving Together program-are not widely available to people in their local communities. Innovation: TOGETHER is bridging this gap by using human centered design principles-in which the user is involved with all phases of design and testing-to develop and test an innovative, user-friendly platform for delivering livestreaming virtual group programs to people with ADRD and caregivers in their homes. Investigators: TOGETHER's CEO and PI of this application has expertise in human centered design and successfully led our Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant. Coinvestigators and consultants bring expertise in clinical trials, integrative health, behavioral psychology, geriatrics, qualitative methods, technology and education. Approach: Phase I Progress. Our Phase I SBIR enabled us to develop and demonstrate proof-of-concept for our unique approach to livestreaming virtual group program delivery. We have completed or exceeded all of our milestones, which included: 1) creating the platform in partnership with graduates of our in-person program; 2) pilot-testing the platform in a naïve group of users and 3) refining the platform in preparation for Phase II. The response has been exceptional, with participants highlighting many physical, social, emotional, and logistical benefits. Phase II Aims: The primary goals of this SBIR Phase II grant are to: 1) determine whether livestreaming virtual group delivery of the Moving Together program improves quality of life in people with mild ADRD and caregivers, including exploration of potential mechanisms of action; 2) refine the platform for people with mild cognitive impairment to expand our target audience; and 3) develop an instructor training program to meet the needs of a larger client base. Environment: TOGETHER'S corporate office is in San Francisco, which offers a rich environment for developing and testing innovative technology-based solutions to challenging social problems and is enhanced by involvement of investigators at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and San Francisco VA. Commercialization Plan: After completion of Phase II, we will be prepared to commercialize TOGETHER's telehealth platform, initially using a client pay model, with clear plans for growth and expansion. Summary: TOGETHER's innovative approach to livestreaming virtual group delivery of evidence-based programs for people with ADRD and caregivers in their homes offers tremendous potential to increase access and improve quality of life in this vulnerable and under-served population.",R44,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,10019891,R44AG059520,R44AG059520-02A1,59520,A1,,2020,2,2145,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3081,Intensive Combination Approach to Rollback the Epidemic (iCARE) in Nigerian Adolescents,"Nigeria has the 2nd highest number of people living with HIV (PLWH) and the most pediatric HIV infections globally, however, it has been neglected as a focus of public health efforts. Progress towards UNAIDS 90-90- 90 goals in Nigeria has been slow with all goals < 35%. Youth and men who have sex with men (MSM), are the weakest link in Nigeria's response to the HIV epidemic. Interventions reaching youth (including hard-to-reach MSM) and improving HIV care outcomes across the HIV care continuum should involve combination interventions as these have additive benefits compared to single interventions. In this study, we propose to build on infrastructure developed through a very successful U.S-Nigeria HIV-centered academic partnership in collaboration with partner institutions in Ibadan, Lagos and Jos, Nigeria. We will test two combination interventions among youths aged 15 to 24 years across the HIV care continuum. In the UG3 phase, we will (Aim 1) develop manualized interventions for: (a) HIV testing and linkage; and (b) HIV care outcomes among youth age 15-24 years in Ibadan using a combination approach that includes theoretically-grounded peer navigation and mHealth components. Once developed we will (Aim 2) test each combination intervention in pilot trials in Ibadan for feasibility, acceptability and initial efficacy using a pre-post design. The two interventions include: 2a) social media engagement + peer navigation to improve HIV testing and linkage to care among young MSM. The pilot test for this intervention will be considered successful if there is an increase of ≥ 30% in the number of young men completing HIV tests and an increase in the HIV incidence rate by OR=2.0 over a 48-week period compared to baseline. In addition, we will pilot test: 2b) a short message service (SMS; via adaptation of an evidence-based intervention, TXTXT) + peer navigation intervention to improve HIV care outcomes (e.g. care retention, ART adherence and viral suppression) among 40 young PLWH. This pilot intervention will be considered successful if there is ≥ 30% increase in proportion with viral load < 1000 copies/mL over a 48-week period, reflecting an effect size of OR=1.5 compared to baseline. We will also assess feasibility for measurement of medication adherence (via ART concentration in hair) and retention in care (via medical records abstraction). In the UH3 phase we will (Aim 3) demonstrate the scalability and efficacy of the two combination interventions in different HIV seroprevalence settings in Nigeria by: 3a) conducting a randomized stepped wedge trial (5 steps, 6 sites) in Ibadan, Lagos and Jos; and 3b) testing ART adherence and retention in care as mediators AND age, gender, and mode of transmission as potential moderators of the HIV care intervention effect. We hypothesize that, using the same primary outcome measures as in the UG3, the effect size of each combination intervention across and within settings, will be ≥ the effects observed in the UG3.

3091,Optimal Physical and Cognitive Rest after Sports-Related Concussions among Youth,"Sports-related concussions are a major public health problem in the US, affecting 1.6 to 3.8 million youth each year. These concussions can disrupt brain function and contribute to long- term severe health conditions. Current guidelines for early clinical management of sports-related concussions call for physical and cognitive rest. However, these guidelines are not strongly evidence-based. Furthermore, the optimal levels of physical and cognitive rest needed to promote recovery are unknown, precluding personalized rest plans for youth with different concussion characteristics. The aims of this study are to: 1) objectively measure the physical and cognitive rest among youth with sports-related concussions, 2) identify optimal levels of rest in relation to post-concussive symptoms (PCS) and functional impairments, and 3) examine the relationship between the levels of rest and PCS and functional impairments for high versus low risk concussions. Youth ages 11 to 17 years old (n = 110) from 18 schools (15 high schools and 3 middle schools) will be recruited and enrolled at the beginning of season through sign consent from parents and assent from youth. Following a confirmed concussion diagnosis, injury information and acute clinical presentation will be assessed at the time of injury as part of routine clinical care. Participating youth will be followed to assess concussion outcomes, including functional impairments, at three time points: within 48 hours of injury, and at day 7 and day 45 post- concussion. A parent/legal guardian of the concussed youth will also be asked to report his/her child's post-concussion outcomes at the three time points. In addition, participating youth will be monitored on daily physical and cognitive rest and PCS, using two electronic devices (Actigraph and Narrative Clip) and daily survey in various lengths until acute symptoms resolve. Objective and real-time data on the type, duration, and intensity of physical and cognitive rest/activity, collected here for the first time, will fill critical knowledge gaps regarding the level of rest needed for optimal recovery from high- or low-risk concussions. This study will provide formative data to support a subsequent randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of different levels of rest/activity on concussion outcomes. More importantly, the results will have a significant impact on clinical practice by shaping standards of care and informing treatment decisions about optimal rest/activity for sports-related concussions among youth. 1",R21,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9181075,R21HD086451,R21HD086451-01A1,86451,A1,,2016,1,2157,Audie,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3096,The St. Jude Lifetime Cohort,"Because many adverse effects of treatment for childhood cancer may not become clinically apparent until the survivor attains maturity or older ages, continued follow-up across the lifespan, from childhood through adulthood, is essential. With more than 420,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S., there is a critical need to accurately characterize the development and manifestation of very late cancer-related sequel. In 2007, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital initiated a unique clinical (i.e., medically evaluated) cohort with the primary aim of establishing lifelong evaluation of health-related and quality of life outcomes in aging adult survivors of pediatric cancer. Eligibility for participatio in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) is survival > 10 years from diagnosis, and attained age of > 18 years. As of January, 2014, 3026 survivors (90 percent of those contacted and 80 percent of those eligible) have successfully completed one or more evaluations (typically involving a 3-4 day outpatient visit) providing a rich repository of biospecimens and outcomes data that has been used to more accurately characterize the prevalence of adverse biomedical and psychosocial outcomes, to identify demographic, genetic, treatment and psychosocial/behavioral-related predictors of negative health outcome, to inform ongoing health surveillance recommendations, and to guide health preserving interventions. The SJLIFE cohort has yielded important findings including determination of a more accurate prevalence of cancer treatment-related organ dysfunction among adults treated for cancer during childhood, investigation of innovative methods of health surveillance, and identification of novel and unexpected late health outcomes. However, the current sample size of the SJLIFE cohort, its restriction to adult participants (i.e., those 18+ years), and methods utilizing risk-directed screening imposes limits on the potential for significant new discovery. Thus, to enhance the SJLIFE cohort and its ability to advance our understanding about how the diagnosis of cancer during childhood and its associated therapeutic exposures impact long-term health, we propose to: (1) expand eligibility of the SJLIFE cohort to include a clinically well-characterized cohort o five- year survivors, (2) undertake uniform medical assessments in all cohort participants, (3) develop and test innovative methodologies to maintain the SJLIFE cohort, and (4) establish a resource for future innovative intervention-based research. Over the five-years of the grant, the SJLIFE cohort will be expanded to include approximately 9800 five-year survivors (i.e., evaluable for late mortality), of whom 7825 are projected to be alive and will agree to actively participate in SJLIFE (i.e., available for longitudinal assessment of morbidity and quality of life outcomes). The SJLIFE cohort will be unique in its ability to provide new insights into the risks and pathophysiology of morbidity associated with cancer and its therapy, which is critical to the design of contemporary treatment protocols and public health initiatives to facilitate survivor access to preventive and remedial services.",U01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8884348,U01CA195547,U01CA195547-01,195547,,,2015,1,2162,Leonie,,,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
3112,Augmenting Ankle Plantarflexor Function and Walking Capacity in Children with Cerebral Palsy,"A child's ability to walk effectively is essential to their physical health and general well-being. Unfortunately, many children with cerebral palsy (CP), the most common cause of pediatric physical disability, have difficulty walking and completing higher-intensity ambulatory tasks. This leads to children with CP engaging in levels of habitual physical activity that are well below guidelines and those of children without disabilities, which in turn contributes to many secondary conditions, including metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. There is broad clinical consensus that plantarflexor dysfunction is a primary contributor to slow, inefficient, and crouched walking patterns in CP; individuals with CP need more effective treatments and mobility aids for plantarflexor dysfunction. To meet this need, this proposal aims to evaluate a holistic strategy to address impaired mobility from plantarflexor dysfunction in CP using a lightweight, dual-mode (assistive or resistive) wearable robotic device. This strategy combines two complementary techniques: (1) targeted ankle resistance for neuromuscular gait training that provides precision therapy to elicit long-term improvements in ankle muscle function, and (2) adaptive ankle assistance to make walking easier during sustained, high-intensity, or challenging tasks. The first specific aim is to quantify improvement in ankle muscle function and functional mobility following targeted ankle resistance gait training in ambulatory children with CP. The primary hypothesis for the first aim is that targeted ankle resistance training will produce larger improvements in lower-extremity motor control, gait mechanics, and clinical measures of mobility assessed four- and twelve-weeks post intervention compared to standard physical therapy and standard gait training. The second specific aim is to determine the efficacy of adaptive ankle assistance to improve capacity and performance during sustained, high-intensity, and challenging tasks in ambulatory children with CP. The primary hypothesis for the second aim is that adaptive ankle assistance will result in significantly greater capacity and performance during the six-minute-walk-test and graded treadmill and stair stepping protocols compared to walking with ankle foot orthoses and walking with just shoes. Both Specific Aims will explore the participant characteristics (e.g., age, gender, GMFCS level, walking speed, spasticity rating) that are associated with the greatest improvement in outcomes following each intervention to provide guidance for future clinical and at-home implementation. The proposed studies will establish fundamental knowledge on the ability for adaptive ankle interventions to treat walking impairment relative to standard of care in CP.",R01,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10345932,R01HD107277,R01HD107277-01,107277,,,2021,1,2178,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,

Our central hypothesis is that retention in the HIV care cascade and treatment outcomes are influenced by patient-level demographic, clinical, developmental, and behavioral factors, as well as, factors within the ambient health care and broader contextual environment. We will leverage our strengths, including robust working relationships with HIV treatment programs, a substantial harmonized regional database, plus broad experience in sampling-based methodologies and novel analytical approaches. Over the course of this research we will: SA-1: Describe movement through the HIV care cascade with a focus on identifying broader and health care environment contextual factors that influence optimal retention in care and viral suppression, in the face of global disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in donor funding priorities. The Post COVID-19 Double-Sampling Cohort (Post COVID) will address the impact of broader contextual factors (COVID-19) while the Telehealth and Structural Adaptations project will address the impact of health care structure. SA-2: Examine the impact of developmental stage and behavioral factors on retention in the cascade and subsequent outcomes. The multiregional Adolescent and Young Adult Network of IeDEA (AYANI) and regional Measuring Adverse Pregnancy and Newborn Congenital Outcomes (MANGO) cohorts will assess the impact of developmental stage on the cascade, while the Syndemics cohort will address the impact of mental health on the cascade.SA- 3: Examine the immediate and long-term outcomes of people diagnosed with Tuberculosis (TB) with a focus on identifying and addressing factors associated with patient outcomes.

3129,Wearable Cardiomechanics Monitor to Decrease Heart Failure Readmissions,"Heart failure (HF) is one of the most major challenges faced by society today, claiming hundreds of thousands of American lives each year and costing more than 30 billion Medicare dollars annually. The ultimate goal of this research is to create a non-invasive and unobtrusive system for monitoring HF patients at home, automatically assessing their risk of experiencing an exacerbation, and providing feedback to caregivers and the patients themselves. This will enable proactive management of HF at home, with patients receiving tailored therapies that can adapt continuously to meet their changing needs. The hypothesis is that by (1) measuring a combination of hemodynamics, activity, and cardiovascular response to stressors (e.g. exercise) at home, and (2) combining these heterogeneous measures with modern data analytics, prediction of HF exacerbation at home can be achieved with a predictive window of greater than 7 days before impending hospitalization. To examine this hypothesis, the following four specific aims are proposed: (1) to collect longitudinal hemodynamic (ballistocardiogram, BCG) and activity data unobtrusively at home for the first time in a population of elderly HF patients; (2) to adapt existing algorithms fo predicting an impending HF exacerbation based on BCG, ECG, and activity time series data; (3) to develop wearable hardware based on BCG to be used at home for continuous hemodynamic and activity recording from elderly HF patients; and (4) to develop innovative sensing strategies and algorithms for improving the robustness of wearable BCG measurements. A previously demonstrated and verified weighing scale for center-of-mass (COM) BCG measurement will be scaled-up and deployed in the home of 200 total patients over the course of the project. Simultaneously, the hardware and analytics efforts will build on our prior data and existing prototypes. For the first 25 participants in the take-home BCG study, we will also conduct a direct physiologic study to quantify the underlying mechanisms contributing to both the scale-based (COM) and wearable BCG measurements, and to develop computational techniques for converting between the two domains (COM versus surface vibrations of the chest). These techniques, in combination with iterative and experimental efforts to improve the robustness of wearable BCG measurements, will then be applied to optimizing the wearable system for BCG and activity monitoring. This system will then be scaled-up and deployed in the home for the final 50 participants (of 200) in the take-home study. While we anticipate that the wearable will provide the best solution, the project risk is mitigated through the validation efforts with the existing scale-based system. Successful completion of this project could ultimately reduce HF related hospitalizations, and thus both improve quality of life for elderly Americans, and reduce overall healthcare costs.",R56,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9144990,R56AG048458,R56AG048458-01A1,48458,A1,,2015,1,2195,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
3138,Mobile Intervention to Reduce Pain and Improve Health (MORPH) in Obese Older Adults,"Chronic pain has emerged as an urgent age-related health issue that significantly compromises physical functioning and quality of life, with the adverse effects amplified by both obesity and sedentary behavior. The annual cost of pain in the United States is nearly 30% higher than the combined costs of cancer and diabetes. In 2016, the NIH called for a National Pain Strategy to: 1) expand non-pharmacological treatment options in older adults, who are particularly susceptible to the side effects of opioid and other pain medications; 2) develop accessible treatments that are tailored to individuals; and 3) increase the development of self-management programs for chronic pain. The purpose of this R-21 is to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, patient-centered intervention to reduce chronic pain and improve physical functioning in older adults, leveraging the combination of telecoaching and individually-adaptive mHealth tools to decrease both body mass and sedentary behavior. The proposal consists of two phases. The first phase will use an iterative user-centered design process to develop the mHealth application, to adapt the weight loss and sedentary behavior components of the intervention to a telecoaching model, and to evaluate the usability and feasibility of the intervention for obese, older adults with chronic pain. In the second phase we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to provide initial evidence for effect sizes (pain and physical function) associated with the proposed intervention, and to estimate the sample size needed for a full scale randomized controlled trial design that compare the effects of the intervention versus usual care on pain ratings and physical function in overweight/obese older adults with chronic pain.",R21,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9433229,R21AG058249,R21AG058249-01,58249,,,2018,1,2204,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
3142,Project SEARCH (Scanning EARs for Child Health),"One of the most pervasive and frustrating public health challenges in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) is identifying individuals over time and space. The success of non-communicable disease (NCD) management, antiretroviral therapy, tuberculosis treatment, antenatal care, infant vaccinations, and even longitudinal research studies, hinges upon accurate identification at initial contact and re-identification thereafter. Currently, systems for individual identification in LMICs are either lacking or woefully inadequate.2 This perpetuates an inefficient status quo that burdens patients and families with coordinating their own longitudinal care. Surely we can do better. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in developing electronic medical records (EMRs) and information technology systems for hospitals and health care centers in LMICs, seeking to facilitate longitudinal care. Yet it is self-evident that electronic records offer no benefit over paper records unless the identification problem has already been solved, which is hardly the case. With the proliferation of smart phone ownership and expanding cellular network coverage, mHealth Apps may be ideally suited to solving the identification problem.7 In Project SEARCH (Scanning EARs for Child Health), our multidisciplinary team of public health, engineering, and computer science faculty and students at Boston University (BU), partnering with private-sector social enterprise software companies, have focused on solving the identification problem through pattern recognition analysis of biometric data, using ear morphology as the identifier. Biometric data offer distinct advantages over external identifiers. By definition, biometric features are intrinsic and cannot be lost, left at home, sold, or traded. And the choice of ears is logical, offering clear advantages over other biometric identifiers. Over the past four years, with funds from a BU pilot grant and a crowd-funding campaign, we have developed a beta-test prototype of the SEARCH App. Our App runs a powerful, open-source, pattern recognition algorithm (Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT)), operates on Apple iOS or Android platforms, and has been programmed to be integrated within a popular open-source EMR that itself runs on smartphones (CommCare, Dimagi, Inc.). In a 2017 study among 194 BU undergraduates, SEARCH achieved 96% first rank matching, and 99.6% matching within the top 10. This establishes strong proof of concept and justifies taking the next logical step: evaluation and field testing in Zambia. Our overarching goal in Project SEARCH is to create a powerful but simple, non-invasive, user-friendly system for individual patient identification, optimized for use in LMIC settings, that is acceptable to patients, caregivers, and providers alike.",R21,TW,FIC,TW,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9546052,R21TW010939,R21TW010939-01,10939,,,2018,1,2208,Josh,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3146,Unintended Prolonged Opioid Use,"Misuse of prescription opioids remains a public health crisis. Appropriate short-term use of these medications in opioid-naïve patients is indicated in select health care settings, but intentional short-term use is emerging as a previously under-recognized segue to unintended prolonged opioid use (UPOU). Clinical strategies aimed at preventing UPOU in health care settings are lacking due, in part, to absence of information about how this poorly-understood clinical phenomenon develops. Investigators at Mayo Clinic recently organized a group of thought leaders to develop a conceptual framework to explain UPOU. Such a framework is essential both to guide the study of this problem and to identify potential targets for interventions to reduce UPOU. The framework is comprised of three domains, including (1) patient characteristics; (2) practice environment characteristics; and (3) opioid prescriber characteristics that interact to either facilitate or impede UPOU. Within each domain, potential factors, drawn from the relevant literature, moderate or mediate the influence of each domain. However, much of the information needed to evaluate this framework does not currently exist. The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) provides unique potential opportunities for translational research, including identifying subjects eligible for study participation and serving as a data sources for retrospective or prospective studies. However, interoperability between EHRs poses a considerable challenge to taking advantage of these opportunities. Researchers at the Yale School of Medicine recently launched Hugo, a secure mobile personal health (mHealth) platform that enables patients to access their information from multiple EHRs and other healthcare information sources, including commercial pharmacy records. The Hugo platform has tremendous potential to facilitate clinical research, especially research conducted across multiple centers - as information from diverse source systems at each institution can be easily integrated into a common dataset. In this application, four CTSA hubs (Mayo Clinic, University of Minnesota, University of Michigan, and Yale) will explore the Hugo platform's potential to facilitate clinical research, with the UPOU study as a use case. We will use the Hugo platform to identify incident cases of UPOU and prospectively recruit patients and opioid prescribers for assessments, as well as to evaluate the proposed conceptual framework using structural equation models. At this study's conclusion, we will have successfully deployed a highly innovative mHealth platform across multiple centers and this platform will be immediately available for widespread dissemination across the entire CTSA consortium and other clinical research sites. The information gained about UPOU will significantly advance core knowledge about this poorly understood clinical phenomenon. This newly acquired information will be used design, test, and deploy prevention strategies aimed at mitigating the risks of UPOU.",U01,TR,NCATS,TR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9738962,U01TR002743,U01TR002743-01,2743,,,2019,1,2212,Audie,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3147,Penn Innovation in Suicide Prevention Implementation Research (INSPIRE) Center,"This proposal is to develop the University of Pennsylvania's Innovation in Suicide Prevention Implementation Research (INSPIRE) Center. Suicide is a leading cause of death in the US that disproportionately affects minority and disenfranchised populations, including Blacks, Hispanics and sexual/gender minorities. Yet, these groups often are not included in suicide prevention research. Guided by a conceptual model based on the Integrated Behavior Model, which posits that organizational culture, policies, and resources (or lack thereof) impact the provider's attributes and behaviors, INSPIRE brings together psychology, implementation science, health economics, machine learning, health information technology, psychiatry and participatory research experts to apply innovative interdisciplinary approaches to suicide prevention. INSPIRE's overarching goals are to develop and adapt practice-based and other suicide prevention interventions for underserved groups and to design and test implementation strategies to optimize how evidence-based practices can be brought to scale efficiently and with high fidelity, for optimal effectiveness. INSPIRE will prioritize strategies that can be rapidly deployed in a range of practice settings, including those with limited resources, thereby increasing their reach and public health impact. Penn INSPIRE will use state-of-the-science methods from participatory research to actively engage stakeholders from many sectors - including patients, providers, and payers - at every level of its work to accomplish its Specific Aims. INSPIRE will apply innovative, interdisciplinary behavior change and implementation science methods to develop, adapt, and evaluate cost effective interventions. A Signature Project will use a stepped wedge study design to test an innovative organizational strategy that leverages telehealth to deliver high quality Safety Planning Intervention and follow-up services in Emergency Departments. Three Exploratory Projects will test novel strategies for suicide prevention across individual, clinician, and organizational levels and with specific vulnerable populations that will lay the foundation for more definitive studies. INSPIRE will also support 10 pilot projects and an innovative Methods Core that will develop and test new methods to advance research at the intersection of suicide prevention and implementation science. The Suicide Prevention Scholars Program will expand the cadre of suicide prevention researchers by engaging both emerging investigators and established scientists who do not currently work on suicide prevention - particularly those from groups under-represented in research - through content, design. and methodological mentoring and capacity-building. By catalyzing interdisciplinary, cross-sector collaborations and advancing suicide prevention research, care, and policy both locally and nationally, we will develop cost-effective, practical, and efficient ways to implement evidence-based suicide prevention interventions.

3148,Remote Methods to Biochemically Verify Smoking Status,"NCI has nearly 50 ongoing grants to develop and test remotely delivered, technology-based smoking cessation interventions (e.g., apps, websites, text messaging). Remote cessation trials face one key methodological limitation that undermines rigor: the need for biochemical verification of smoking status to accurately assess intervention efficacy. Funding agencies are now strongly encouraging, if not requiring, biochemical verification of smoking in all cessation trials regardless of whether the intervention is delivered in-person or remotely. Incorporation of biochemical indicators of smoking status is critically important as inaccurate assessment of smoking status may lead to dissemination of ineffective treatments and stagnant rates of population-level cessation. Remote collection of expired-air carbon monoxide (CO) is a non-invasive approach that can be used to verify smoking status. Remote CO offers the potential to inform episodic assessment of smoking (e.g., at 1, 3, or 6 months) as is typically done for clinical trial endpoints. Beyond clinical trials, remote CO offers the potential to enhance human-lab methods by providing ecological granular assessment of day-to-day fluctuations in smoking. However, extant trials that have implemented remote methods to assess CO have utilized CO monitors that would be cost-prohibitive ($700-$1,200) to include in large-scale remote trials. Smartphone-enabled CO monitors have recently become available and could dramatically improve the feasibility of remote CO collection. Such monitors are available at substantially lower cost (~$72) than traditional monitors, can be used with any iOS- or Android-compatible mobile device, and detect continuous CO concentrations of 0-100 parts per million. Although these new monitors expand the methodologic potential to capture CO remotely, several issues must first be resolved. Most critically, CO collection via smartphone-enabled monitor must be: 1) integrated in real- time with other research outcomes, 2) valid when compared to gold-standard approaches for biochemical verification, and 3) feasible as applied both to granular and episodic data collection. We herein propose to develop and refine an integrated system through which a smartphone-enabled CO monitor (iCO™ Smokerlyzer) is paired with secure online data capture via REDCap. This system will 1) initiate an iCO™ reading, 2) video record the participant providing a CO reading, 3) translate the iCO™'s raw signal into a CO level, and 4) save the CO level to a REDCap database integrated with other assessments. Subsequently, we will examine: a) validity of the remote CO data capture system as compared to gold-standard methods for biochemical verification and b) compliance with remote CO monitoring as applied both to episodic and granular data collection. This project will develop and validate a tool that could fill the gap for a low-cost, feasible method to biochemically verify smoking status within the context of NIH's growing portfolio of remote and/or technology-enhanced cessation treatments and has clear potential to improve the rigor of remote assessment of smoking behavior.",R21,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9884111,R21CA241842,R21CA241842-01A1,241842,A1,,2020,1,2214,Josh,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3151,Drug Free Nerve Block Device for the Relief of Pain and Symptoms in Migraines and other Headaches,"Migraines and headaches are difficult to treat debilitating neurological conditions that leave physicians and their patients with few options for sustained relief from severe chronic pain. All available therapies have considerable side-effects or limitations, leading many patients to resort to drug cocktails including narcotics. To reduce or eliminate the need to use opiates and systemic pharmaceuticals to treat headaches and migraine, Thermaquil developed the first noninvasive, drug-free, patient-controlled reversible nerve block device for long term pain management based on novel mechanisms-of-action that we discovered. Thermaquil has met with more than 300 physicians and headache patients who have vetted and guided the development of Thermaquil's noninvasive nerve block device. The system is designed to easily be used during normal daily activities. We've demonstrated clear efficacy of thermal neuromodulation in single-arm studies with highly complex patients who have tried and failed all other available treatments. Our 45 participants' baseline pain of 6.1 ± 1.7 was significantly reduced to 2.6 ± 2.5 ( p < 0.05, p = 6e-12). Most participants have had constant headache every day over the past 28 days, which would exclude them from most other headache and migraine clinical trials. The proposed study begins with a 28-day lead-in phase to establish a baseline for participant headache frequency, intensity, medications used, other healthcare utilization, and quality of life. After the baseline period, all participants are randomized into active or control arms and given a single treatment. The study continues for 12 weeks with active versus control therapy arms before all participants are given active therapy for an additional 12 weeks. This sham-controlled study will provide evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the Thermaquil device relieving migraine and headache attacks. Successful completion of the project will 1) justify the company to pursue a larger efficacy/pivotal trial to move towards regulatory approval and 2) result in additional investment opportunities for Thermaquil to expedite our clinical program to rapidly bring this product to market to help stop migraine and other pain for individuals with chronic migraine or other headaches.",R44,NS,NINDS,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,10386456,R44NS115460,R44NS115460-02,115460,,,2021,2,2217,Tom,,,,,,,,,
3155,ReACT an Adaptive Mobile Health Intervention for Adolescent Asthma,"Pediatric asthma affects over 8% of youth and is a leading cause of morbidity. Adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) can prevent asthma-related morbidity, however, adolescents with asthma commonly take fewer than 50% of their prescribed doses of ICS when assessed objectively. There are efficacious behavioral health interventions for improving adherence to ICS that are delivered in-person. However, the fact that the majority of adolescent do not take their medication as prescribed signals a clear problem with scaling the solutions to meet the public health need. Recent advances in smartphones and mobile health technologies provide a ubiquitous platform that can circumvent scalability challenges while concurrently approximating the active ingredients of existing behavioral health interventions. During the first decade of development, smartphone interventions for adolescents have largely relied on static text based reminders to cue adherence. With the invention of mobile sensors that wirelessly track ICS adherence, new approaches to intervention are possible that more closely mirror efficacious in-person interventions. The aims of this application are to merge the efficacious behavior change strategies found in behavioral health interventions with scalable mHealth technologies through the development and refinement of the Responsive Asthma Care for Teens program (ReACT). ReACT intervention content will be developed through an iterative user-centered design process that includes 1) an advisory board of youth with asthma, a pediatric pulmonologist, and a behavioral health expert, 2) one-on-one interviews with our target users, and 3) crowdsourced feedback. In tandem, we will program ReACT algorithms to tailor intervention behavior. We will conduct a 6-month randomized controlled trial followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to test the feasibility, acceptability, utilization, and efficacy of ReACT. A sample of 110 adolescents with persistent asthma will be randomized to receive ReACT or a static mHealth medication reminder control. A mHealth control condition enhances rigor by being an active comparator, limiting potential confounding variables, and allowing for isolation of the JITAI design. Feasibility and usability data will be collected throughout the trial and will be determined by examining enrollment and attrition rates and usage statistics. We will conduct a mixed-methods assessment of ReACT acceptability at the end of the 6-month intervention. Efficacy outcomes include changes in objectively monitored adherence to ICS (primary outcome), lung function, asthma control, asthma-related quality of life, and asthma-related morbidity. Data to evaluate efficacy outcomes will be collected at baseline, 3-, 6- 9- and 12-month assessment visits. We will evaluate theoretical mechanisms of change by testing for changes in capability, opportunity, and motivation (COM-B) as mediators of intervention outcomes. If successful, this intervention offers excellent potential for wide spread dissemination to address a pressing public health problem.",R56,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9769218,R56HL141394,R56HL141394-01A1,141394,A1,,2018,1,2222,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,

Older sepsis survivors are commonly discharged to long-term acute care facilities, where they often die within 1 year. We believe that those who return home from the hospital lose the momentum of physical function improvement after early in-hospital rehabilitation and often face exacerbation of comorbidities and decline in physical function. Based on our longitudinal observational data, older sepsis survivors have poor health status and physical function lasting at least 1 year after sepsis, and in contrast with younger survivors, older patients do not regain their function. Our aging research suggests that physical activity interventions prevent mobility disability in rather healthy older adults, but older sepsis survivors will be profoundly frailer, more sedentary, lower- functioning and will unlikely be capable of traveling to participate in supervised exercise training programs in our research facilities. Currently, we are unaware of any home-based therapeutic approaches to improve physical function of older sepsis survivors. Current mobile health applications can deliver structured home-based exercise programs to reach daily activity goals. For example, the Blue Marble Health Platform (BMHP), developed and validated with the support of NIH contains over 100 avatar-guided strengthening, balance, and aerobic exercises, along with 23 standardized assessments and a personal health diary. This digital and remotely monitored exercise training program might be promising for sepsis survivors with poor health status, who are unlikely to be able to travel to participate in exercise interventions. Our proposed study will test the safety, feasibility and efficacy of a novel 12-week physical activity intervention to improve physical function in older sepsis survivors utilizing an app-based digital exercise training platform. We propose to randomize 40 sepsis survivors (aged >65 years) with an SPPB score <6 at the time of their discharge to home from the hospital into the intervention or a standard care control group. Both groups will receive a tablet with the BMHP app, which contains all of the physical function assessments, and a health diary. The intervention group will also receive personalized avatar-guided exercises as well as text message reminders to exercise for 30min each day, 5 days/week. For the control group, participants will record their daily activities using the BMHP health diary. A research coordinator will call all participants weekly to ask questions about their health status and remind them to charge the tablets. At baseline and 12-week follow-up, participants will use the app to complete the app- guided physical function assessments and we will measure activity levels using hip-worn accelerometers. This project will be the first to test the safety, feasibility and efficacy of a digital physical activity intervention in this high-risk population of older sepsis survivors. The results will provide critical information regarding the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of this novel approach to enhance these patients' physical function.",R21,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10353548,R21AG075645,R21AG075645-01,75645,,,2022,1,2223,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
3161,Individually tailored physical activity intervention for Latina adolescents: Ninas Saludables,"Latina adolescents report low levels of physical activity, with only 3% meeting national physical activity guidelines, and are at high lifetime risk for conditions related to inactivity, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Interventions grounded in sound psychosocial theory and leveraging growing technology use in Latina adolescents are needed to reverse patterns of inactivity, establish healthy lifetime habits and reduce widening disparities. Our research team has developed and tested individually tailored web-based interventions to increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), which significantly increased MVPA in Latina adults. In our recent pilot study (R03NR014329), we adapted this intervention based on formative interviews to make it appropriate for Latina adolescents and tested it in a single-arm pilot trial (N=21). After 12 weeks, retention was high (90.5%) and self-reported MVPA increased from 24.7(26.11) minutes/week at baseline to 79.4(46.8) at follow up (p<0.001), suggesting good potential efficacy. In closeout interviews, girls expressed a preference to increase audio-video components of the website and to incorporate other mobile- health technologies, such as texting, smartphone apps, social networks, and wearables. Thus, the aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=200) of an individually tailored, theory-based, multi- technology intervention to increase MVPA in Latina adolescents. The 12-month intervention will comprise a counseling session to teach behavior change techniques, an interactive multimedia website with individually tailored content, a wearable tracker and smartphone app to reinforce behavior change techniques, connection to an Instagram account reinforcing web content, and automated text messages to guide continued goal setting. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention or only a wearable tracker. Activity will be measured at baseline, six-months (primary outcome) and 12 months using well-established MVPA measures (accelerometers and the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Interview). We hypothesize that those randomized to receive the intervention will show significantly greater increases in MVPA at six months than those in the control group. We will also evaluate whether changes in MVPA are mediated by changes in targeted psychosocial constructs (e.g. self-efficacy, social support), and whether intervention effects are moderated by baseline personal and environmental variables (e.g. age, BMI, neighborhood environment). Costs to deliver the intervention (e.g. staff time, materials, overhead) will be tracked to evaluate costs and cost- effectiveness of both study arms, and we will evaluate the effects of contact time out outcomes. We will also explore trajectories of daily activity in both the intervention and control groups using continuous data from wearable trackers. The proposed study will promote a critical preventive health behavior, physical activity, in Latina adolescents using technologies that are pervasive in this high risk population and highly scalable, laying the groundwork for cost-effective, broad reaching interventions with great potential for public health impact.",R01,NR,NINR,NR;OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9738974,R01NR017876,R01NR017876-01A1,17876,A1,,2019,1,2228,Chris,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3168,"Low-Cost, Portable, Point of Care Amplitude-Integrated Electroencephalography (aEEG)","The goal of this project is to develop a portable, low-cost tool to aid in the diagnosis, intervention and improvement of outcomes for neonates born with neurologic complications. The project will develop instrumentation technology to enable early detection of neurologic brain injury and seizure activity for newborns delivered in care facilities that lack a full suite of neurological diagnostic tools. In neonates with birth asphyxia seizures are very common and most frequently subclinical. Many studies have observed that even experienced clinicians have difficulty correctly identifying seizures in this population. Subsequently, clinical paroxysms that do not truly represent seizure are frequently over-treated and subclinical seizures, including status epilepticus, go unrecognized and untreated. As such, the use of continuous video- electroencephalograph (EEG) monitoring is the gold standard for recognizing and treating seizures in this population. It is also very helpful at identifying which children have sustained brain injury, including hypoxia. This resource intense modality has become the standard of care at many tertiary medical centers but unfortunately remains unavailable to many clinicians at smaller birth facilities. Quantitative EEG, including the use of amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), has gained widespread use at most neonatal ICUs, and represents a more user-friendly bedside tool for identifying brain injury and seizures. The goal of the phase I project is to specify, design, prototype, and evaluate a low-cost, telemedicine-enabled aEEG monitor that is portable and supports widespread use in smaller facilities. A prototype instrument will be specified, designed, built, and evaluated.

3185,Intraoperative Near Infrared Molecular Imaging of Lung Cancer,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a devastating disease with a poor outcome. When a patient is first diagnosed with NSCLC, the person would typically undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy and/or therapeutic surgery. These two procedures have technical challenges that limit their success such as inaccurate biopsies, failure to locate nodules and lymph nodes, missed occult tumors, and positive margins. As a consequence, there is a 40% failure rate for these procedures. This Project will use optical imaging in the near-infrared (NIR) range to generate practical solutions to these problems and make these two common procedures safer, more efficient, and have improved outcomes. The goal of this Project is to test the hypothesis that intraoperative imaging in the NIR spectrum with targeted molecular tracers can identify tumor cells in order to improve procedures that are utilized for the management of patients with NSCLC. The innovation of this Program Project will be in the matrix of cocktail dye development, new NIR camera devices, and clinical translation. There are three specific goals of this Project. First, to develop a set of targeted near-infrared molecular imaging contrast agents that are sensitive and specific to a range of distinct targets on NSCLC. Second, to develop and integrate highly NIR spectral sensitive imaging platforms into commonly used white light imaging devices so they can be utilized during clinical procedures. And third, to apply these innovations to solve common clinical problems in order to impact patient care. If successful, the molecular optical imaging solution presented in this proposal would be immediately applicable to several hundred thousand lung cancer patients each year.",P01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10333063,P01CA254859,P01CA254859-01A1,254859,A1,,2022,1,2253,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
3189,Multi-scale modeling of sleep behaviors in social networks,"Sleep is critical to a wide range of biological functions. Inadequate sleep results in impaired cognitive performance and mood, and adverse health outcomes including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence suggests that sleep behaviors can spread between individuals connected by a social network and that these behaviors can even influence drug use in teenagers. While models exist separately for quantifying connectivity within social networks and for modeling sleep, there are currently no combined models for predicting and studying the emergent dynamics of sleep behaviors within social networks. We therefore propose to develop multi-scale physiologically-based models of the effects of social interactions on sleep behaviors. We have assembled a trans-disciplinary team of individuals who have: (i) developed mathematical methods for quantifying social network interactions; (ii) developed a physiologically based model of sleep and circadian physiology, including the effects of wake-promoting stimuli and drugs; (iii) studied healthy and pathological sleep behaviors under inpatient and outpatient conditions, including in undergraduate students; (iv) developed techniques for collecting multiple physiological and behavioral variables; and (v) studied pattern recognition and signal processing techniques for analyzing multimodal data. We will develop statistical and mathematical models from experimental data collected from 8 groups of closely-connected MIT undergraduates using mobile phones and wearable sensors to measure sleep patterns and duration, light exposure, subjective measures of sleepiness and mood, and social interactions including texting, calls, internet use, and spatial proximity to other participants. We will determine how social interactions, sleep duration and timing, light exposure, sleepiness and mood interact. These social interaction effects will then be added to our physiological sleep and circadian model, which will also be extended from the individual to the population level, while the physiological model results will inform the social network model work. Once developed, the mathematical model will be used to explore how emergent dynamics depend on network properties. Specifically, we will simulate the student network, including the observed rates and effects of social interactions. We will then test the effects of modifying the network properties, including the strengths of interactions and the degree of population heterogeneity (model parameter variability). We anticipate that the mathematical model developed in this project will provide a new means of predicting the dynamics of sleep behaviors within social networks. Due to its multi-scale nature, the model will relate observations at the network level to interactions between individuals. This will allow us to simulate candidate strategies for intervening in populations wit unhealthy sleep behaviors. Given the alarming increase in insufficient sleep in the U.S., and the rapidly escalating use of social media, establishing models that can be used to improve sleep behaviors could potentially improve multiple health outcomes.",R01,GM,NIGMS,GM,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8824543,R01GM105018,R01GM105018-03,105018,,,2015,3,2257,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
3198,Leveraging Health Literacy-informed Technology-based Approaches to Support Safe Medication Use By Parents After Discharge of Infants from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,"Infants discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are at high risk for medication-related adverse events. These medically complex infants are often under treatment for multiple conditions conditions, with ~50% discharged home with >1 medication. Two-thirds of parents make medication errors post-NICU discharge, increasing the risk of morbidity. Underdosing/non-adherence can lead to therapeutic failure; overdosing can cause serious adverse effects. The small size/relative physiologic immaturity of these infants renders them less tolerant of even small dosing errors. These errors may be compounded by low health literacy and limited English Proficiency; in addition, stress associated with having a preterm infant contributes to a reduced capacity to manage the cognitive load associated with executing complex post-dischage instructions. The FDA and American Academy of Pediatrics have recognized the complexity of liquid medication administration and the potentially serious implications of errors. Addressing these issues in NICU graduates is important given the high prevalence and potential morbidity associated with errors. Incorporating key health literacy-informed communication strategies (dose demonstration, pictures, teachback) into provider counseling leads to sizeable improvements in medication knowledge, dosing errors, and adherence in the general pediatric population. To date, these strategies have not been studied in the NICU setting. The complexity of medication management in this high risk group may also require more intensive strategies; studies have shown that technology-based strategies can support patient adherence to provider instructions at home, but there has been limited study with NICU graduates. The primary objective of this application is to promote safe medication use/adherence for high risk infants, by leveraging health literacy-informed approaches and mobile health technology to reinforce provider medication counseling and support parent medication management after NICU discharge. We will study HELPix, adapted for NICU graduates, and determine if there is added benefit of HELPix enhancement with TECH (Technology Enhanced Communication in the Home). Existing HELPix components include: 1) low literacy patient-/regimen-specific instruction sheets with optimized instructions [metric-only (mL), doses appropriately rounded, pictographic dose diagram, explicit dosing intervals], 2) dose demonstration, 3) teachback/showback, 4) provision of dosing tool. TECH components include: parent access to health literacy-informed instructions via smartphones post-discharge (i.e. pictographic dose diagrams, animated dose demos, 'virtual' teachback/ showback) and automated dosing reminders. The study will utilize a 3-arm RCT (HELPix+TECH vs. HELPix vs. usual care alone) in the NICU, with these aims: 1) Examine the degree to which HELPix and HELPix+TECH improve parent medication dosing and adherence compared to usual care, 2) Examine whether HELPix and HELPix+TECH can reduce disparities in parent medication dosing and adherence by parent health literacy level (HL) and English Proficiency, 3) Explore if HELPix and HELPix+TECH reduces preventable adverse events.",R21,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9873575,R21HD100804,R21HD100804-01,100804,,,2020,1,2266,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3209,Adapting a pediatric weight management program for implementation via telehealth,"Childhood obesity remains highly prevalent in the United States and is a major contributor to chronic disease. Evidence suggests that obesity in childhood persists into adulthood, predisposing children to cardio-metabolic diseases. Despite national efforts to expand prevention and treatment, racially/ethnically diverse children and those from low-income households have not benefitted equally from such efforts. Children require coordinated and frequent care for weight management, but multiple socioeconomic and geographic barriers, exist for children living in low-income households and perpetuate health disparities. Better solutions are needed to improve access to care and ongoing participation that impact health outcomes. Telehealth is an approach that can improve access, participation, and mitigate barriers, though simply using it is not sufficient to promote equitable access; other barriers may be introduced and result in inequities. The key question is: how can we modify in-person pediatric weight management programs for telehealth to be equitable? The goal of this mixed methods study is to examine telehealth approaches for childhood obesity to understand multi-level factors that impact access and participation in care and adapt a pediatric weight management program for telehealth. For this mentored career development application, we propose leveraging Connect for Health, a study funded by NHLBI and Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) that is implementing an in-person pediatric weight management program. Guided by implementation science frameworks, we will analyze electronic health record (EHR) data of current telehealth approaches, conduct qualitative interviews, develop targeted telehealth adaptations to Connect for Health, and pilot test the optimized telehealth program. My overarching hypothesis is stakeholder- informed telehealth adaptations will result in equitable access to the Connect for Health pediatric weight management program. As a clinician-scientist, the long-term goal of my research is to optimize pediatric health care delivery by improving health outcomes and access to care through implementation science. I have assembled a mentorship team with expertise in childhood obesity, health equity, and implementation science. Along with my research and training plan, I will develop skills in advanced quantitative analyses, mixed methods design, and implementation science that will enable me to achieve my career goals.",K23,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10520484,K23HL161447,K23HL161447-01A1,161447,A1,,2022,1,2277,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
3213,Developing Innovative Interdisciplinary Biomedical Engineering Programs in Africa,"Broad interdisciplinary training programs which address critical needs in low and middle income countries (LMIC) can significantly increase the translation of research findings into realized health benefits. Northwestern University proposes to establish comprehensive training programs in biomedical engineering that includes identification of critical health care needs, product design, delivery, clinical evaluation, scalablity and product launch. The theme of our program involves the development of effective, affordable, and easy to use innovative biomedical devices that can advance diagnostics, therapeutic interventions and disease monitoring. Our proposal builds on Northwestern's successful original Framework Programs for Global Health (Frameworks-1) which supported the development of a multidisciplinary global health curricula and creation of the Center for Global Health in the Feinberg School of Medicine, the Center for Innovation in Global Health Technologies in the McCormick School of Engineering and the Global Health Initiative at the Kellogg School of Management. Frameworks-1 specifically lead to the close collaboration of clinical and basic research involving medical, engineering and business schools as well as the establishment of the Northwestern Global Health Foundation, an independent not-for-profit which supports post-university commercial development of new healthcare products. Our LMIC partners include the University of Cape Town in South Africa, the University of Ibadan and Lagos University in Nigeria, the University of Bamako in Mali, and the University of Nairobi in Kenya. These LMIC institutions have many existing relationships with Northwestern including active faculty and student exchange programs, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI), and the AIDS International Training and Research Program (AITRP), among others. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide the tools to develop critically needed healthcare technologies in LMICs. The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) establish new and enhance existing training programs in biomedical engineering in Africa; 2) train biomedical engineers and medical doctors how to evaluate newly developed testing and treatment products; and 3) train post graduates from business schools to scale up development and launch new products in LMICs. The healthcare technologies to be developed and employed will include any innovation that improves health outcomes and is cost-effective including novel point-of-care medical diagnostic devices, therapeutic interventions, information systems, and telemedicine diagnostics facilitated through mobile phones. Our bottom-up approach and emphasis on South-South research training and assessment makes this proposal unique and ground-breaking.

3215,Enhancing Perinatal Care Support to Improve Maternal Mortality Disparities,"Persistent and worsening racial and ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity and mortality in the US are urgent public health concerns requiring innovative, sustainable solutions. The perinatal period, the time before and after birth, has important implications for a woman's health and that of her child. Unfortunately, standard perinatal care fails to meet the needs of women from Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) communities, especially with consideration to the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and the systemic racism that drive health disparities. Doula care is increasingly recommended to support high-risk BIPOC women during labor and the immediate postpartum period and is posited to mitigate the effects of racism and SDoH in underserved populations. However, a key limitation to doula care is that doulas are largely relegated to working in parallel with the healthcare team and the potential consequences of this include disjointed care coordination and missed opportunities to improve healthcare quality for BIPOC women. Building on our team's prior and current work optimizing perinatal care for medically underserved women, we will develop and evaluate a Well- Mama intervention in 3 participating medical centers in Chicago IL, Baton Rouge LA, and Newark NJ which have some of the highest US rates of maternal morbidity and mortality. The Well-Mama intervention is centered on uninsured and publicly insured pregnant and postpartum BIPOC women supported by Community Doula Navigators (CDNs) who will conduct in-person and telehealth wellness check-ins using the Well-Mama safety checklist; make referrals to resources following the check-ins, with feedback provided to the perinatal care team; lead virtual pregnancy and postpartum support groups; attend select patient visits; and provide labor support. The Well-Mama checklist includes 5 priority topic areas representing leading factors in maternal morbidity and mortality in which to attune doulas and their patients: (a) mental health/depression; (b) cardiovascular symptoms; (c) safety (e.g., guns at home and intimate partner violence); (d) opioid/substance abuse; and (e) social support, self-agency, and well-being. Well-Mama advances a Shared Care Model approach to health care delivery focused on interprofessional collaboration in relation to centering care on the individual patient. Through a Hybrid Type 1 randomized effectiveness-implementation trial of N=576 women, we will compare the effectiveness of the Well-Mama intervention relative to standard perinatal care in improving women's receipt of recommended care components (primary outcome), reducing patient medical distrust and experience of racism/discrimination, increasing health engagement, self-efficacy, and perception of care team quality, and enhancing perinatal care team cohesion (secondary outcomes), while evaluating intervention implementation. Results will optimize doula integrated perinatal care to address the top drivers of maternal morbidity and mortality with the goal of reducing maternal health disparities experienced by pregnant and postpartum BIPOC women.",R01,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10317866,R01MD016280,R01MD016280-01A1,16280,A1,,2021,1,2284,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3237,Partnering with WIC to prevent excessive weight gain in pregnancy,"Institute of Medicine guidelines for weight gain in pregnancy are clear, but evidence-based treatment approaches are not widely available. This evidence gap is particularly pressing for medically vulnerable women - those who are low income and often racial/ethnic minorities. These women have the highest rates of obesity, but almost no resources to support weight control in pregnancy. Without intervention, most will exceed Institute of Medicine recommended gains and incur significant morbidity for themselves and their children. There is preliminary data from our group supporting the efficacy of digital health platforms for delivering antenatal obesity treatment among the medically vulnerable. However, our inexpensive, easily scalable approach has not been integrated and tested in real world settings, limiting broad reach and dissemination potential. Dissemination considerations are especially pressing for socioeconomically disadvantaged and minority populations because of these groups' higher obesity risk, greater potential for experiencing obesity-related comorbidities in pregnancy, and limited finances to afford alternative treatments. The Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Food and Nutrition Program is the leading public health nutrition program for pregnant women and their children in the US, and thus, it is in a unique position to meaningfully impact the obesity epidemic among the more than 9 million disadvantaged participants it serves annually. Yet no demonstrations of effective gestational weight gain interventions exist in WIC. We propose a pragmatic trial designed to rigorously test our antenatal obesity treatment approach integrated into Philadelphia WIC community clinics. We have long-standing relationships with WIC staff and prior experience conducting pragmatic clinical trials in under-resourced settings. We will randomize 438 African American and Hispanic Philadelphia County WIC participants with obesity in early pregnancy to one of two treatment arms: 1) standard WIC care; or 2) an antenatal obesity treatment arm, which includes empirically-supported behavior change goals, regular self-monitoring text messages with automated feedback, tailored skills training materials, and counseling from WIC nutritionists. Our primary outcome is prevalence of excessive gestational weight gain; we will additionally examine changes in diet and physical activity, health-related quality of life, and rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We will use the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework to evaluate the intervention's dissemination potential and cost effectiveness in the WIC setting.

The conference, which attracts more than 800 attendees, will focus on several topics that represent key research areas in the field of chronobiology, including molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, neurobiology, physiology, metabolism, cancer, aging, infectious disease, immunology, behavior, sleep, mathematical modeling, environmental science and drug development. The theme of the meeting will be """"Rhythms of Life: from Molecules to Policy."" This theme reflects the extent to which biological rhythmicity affects all aspects of life in all organisms living in their natural environment, and the importance of aligning public health and occupational strategies with our understanding of how biological rhythms influence human and environmental health. The meeting will feature 18 symposia of invited speakers, 16 slide sessions with short talks, two special sessions, two plenary lectures, and ~400 posters that combine the best of basic clock research with research that translates this information into the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease. The symposium speakers and session chairs are recognized leaders in their fields, and were chosen to represent the breadth of the field and realize our goal of bridging basic and applied circadian clock research. A majority of slide session speakers are trainees (postdocs or graduate students), and starting in 2022 a limited number of major symposium speakers will be trainees. Large efforts are being made to recruit scientists from other fields, not usually attending SRBR, as speakers. Special attention has been given to cultural and geographical diversity as well as gender balance. We aim to attract scientists from diverse backgrounds through targeted advertisement and, with NIH support, to offer travel fellowships to trainees, prioritizing those from under-represented groups. Various new and previously successful communication initiatives will ensure a broader dissemination of knowledge. Training aspects of the meeting are fully developed, and include a highly subscribed, free, one-day Trainee Professional Development Day, Junior Faculty Workshops, and a Mentoring Program.

3257,Real-time prediction of marijuana use & effects of use on cognition in the natural environment,"Some young adult marijuana (MJ) users report adverse effects of MJ use on cognition that impact daily functioning, with negative consequences such as injury and fatality due to driving while under the influence of MJ. Research on the effects of MJ use on cognition, however, has produced mixed findings. MJ effects on cognition may depend on factors such as history and current severity of marijuana use, time since last MJ use (including possible MJ withdrawal effects), and gender. This R21 aims to address limitations of existing research by (1) starting to develop an algorithm to predict MJ use using smartphone data in regular/heavy MJ users based on ""routine"" or ""habitual use"", and (2) examining effects of MJ use on cognition using smartphone- based cognitive testing in the natural environment. Development of an algorithm to predict MJ use would facilitate systematic assessment of MJ effects on cognitive functioning through more efficient scheduling of smartphone cognitive testing among regular/heavy MJ users in relation to daily routines. Cognitive testing by smartphone in the natural environment is an innovative method that has shown validity, and permits sampling of cognitive functioning within and across days in relation to MJ use. This project will enroll non-treatment seeking young adult (ages 18-25) MJ users from the community, representing ""low"", ""regular"", and ""heavy"" MJ use, with 50% female at each level of use. Participants will complete a baseline lab assessment, 30-day data collection using smartphone and wearable devices (e.g., wristband), and a debriefing interview. Piloting will optimize the protocol and methods for compliance. Smartphones will collect continuously sensed data (e.g., geolocation) for input to an algorithm to predict MJ use in regular/heavy MJ users. This R21 will identify which types of data, available through smartphone, provide optimal detection of routines in MJ use among regular/heavy users. Smartphone cognitive testing will be administered at various times during acute MJ intoxication and various naturalistically occurring lengths of MJ abstinence to examine effects of MJ use on selected aspects of cognitive functioning in daily life. Development of an algorithm to predict MJ use in regular/heavy MJ users based on smartphone data could, for example, facilitate real-time assessment of MJ effects on cognition through improved sampling of cognition in relation to acute and non-acute effects of MJ use. This R21 will provide the foundation for a research program that aims to examine MJ effects on cognitive functioning in vivo, and could support the development of just-in-time intervention to reduce MJ use. This R21 aligns with NIDA's strategic goal of determining consequences of drug use, and cross-cutting themes of highlighting real-world relevance of research and leveraging mobile health technologies to reduce drug use.",R21,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9329948,R21DA043181,R21DA043181-01A1,43181,A1,,2017,1,2327,Josh,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3277,The HOPE App: An Immersive Telehealth Solution for Older Adults with Diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is an epidemic. An estimated 34 million people in the US have T2DM and 84 million have pre-diabetes - nearly half of whom are adults 65+ yo, putting many older adults at higher risk of unhealthy aging and cognitive decline. A healthy lifestyle can treat and even reverse T2DM. But making lifestyle changes is hard and many people fail, contributing to $327B in US healthcare costs. Diabetes group visits (DGV) and diabetes self- management education and support (DSME/S) help people with T2DM to learn and sustain complex disease management skills. Yet, access to DSME/S is limited such participation in DSME/S programs is reportedly as low as 7% among adults with T2DM. New technologies supporting DSME/S programs are emerging, but most fail to meet the unique needs of older adults with limited technology fluency, creating a new digital divide. See Yourself Health (SYH) aims to bridge this digital health gap for older adults with a newly designed immersive learning and telehealth application - the HOPE App - designed to deliver high-impact, high engagement diabetes care and DSME/S tailored for older adults with diabetes. Advancements in virtual reality software, new cloud gaming technology and user interface design have enabled our team to envision a new telehealth and immersive learning environment to support chronic disease self- management needs of older adults with diabetes. We use virtual reality, telecommunication technology and social gaming strategies to offer real-time peer support, care coaching, and 28 modules of live-action experiential learning programs to help participants master complex diabetes self-management skills. In our Phase I SBIR project, we reached the following milestones: prototyped the HOPE App platform with cloud access and new navigation and communication features; completed usability testing (SUS = 71) with 20 target users and feasibility testing (100% participation) of the HOPE App platform; developed new DSME content for older adults. In Phase II, we will further develop the HOPE App patient engagement and population health management features and capabilities and then assess its efficacy in a fully powered clinical trial. Specific Aim 1: Develop the HOPE App's state-of-the-art immersive patient engagement experience with automated onboarding, social networking and gamified DSME/S features to support long-term patient retention. Specific Aim 2: Develop the HOPE App's predictive analytic capabilities for population health management. Specific Aim 3: Clinical validation of the HOPE App intervention on six-month clinical outcomes (A1c), patient reported outcomes (diabetes distress) and engagement (patient retention, adherence to DSME/S). SYH has assembled an expert business team to sell the HOPE APP to our target customer, health care payors. The HOPE APP offers a simple, high- impact, highly engaging, immersive telehealth experience with the potential to become a ubiquitous diabetes management tool to transform diabetes patients into high performing drivers of their own care.",R44,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,Yes,Awarded,10482490,R44AG072990,R44AG072990-02,72990,,,2022,2,2347,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3290,A badge-like exposure device for occupational safety and epidemiological study,"Chemical exposure poses a threat to the safety and health of each of us, especially those who work in certain industries, such as petroleum extraction and refinery facilities, mining industry, and fertilizer factories. Various sensing technologies have been developed over the past decades to address the need, but a low cost and accurate personal exposure device that can track multiple chemical pollutants in real-time is not yet commercially available. This fast track project will develop, test, and validate a badge-like chemical exposure monitor using a Flow-Colorimetric Sensing (FCS) technology to detect multiple chemicals continuously and simultaneously. Phase 1 of the project will focus on developing the FCS platform that combines the strengths of colorimetry and microfluidics, and validate its performance for monitoring three key chemicals (NO2, O3, and HCHO). Phase 2 will expand the chemicals to six most common chemical pollutants in the workplaces (NO2, O3, HCHO, CO, SO2, and NH3), develop a badge-like personal exposure device, and validate it for occupational safety and for environmental exposure related disease studies. The FCS platform is expandable and configurable, which can thus include additional chemicals, or be configured to cover chemicals selected for a particular need. The proposed badge-like device has following key features: 1) calibration-free and multiplexed detection of multiple chemicals, 2) unobtrusive user-experience, 3) expandable and flexible to cover different chemicals based on the need, and 4) low cost (~$100 for device). TF Health Co. has a track record in developing and commercializing chemical sensors for environmental and health applications, and its collaborator in the Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors at ASU has all the necessary expertise and facilities to develop, characterize, and test chemical sensors. The team has worked together to successfully carry out several projects, and is ready to overcome technical challenges and develop the first wearable multi-analyte device in this fast track project. The proposed device, if successfully developed and validated, will have a great potential to contribute to occupational safety and environmental health research.",R44,ES,NIEHS,ES,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9558724,R44ES029006,R44ES029006-01A1,29006,A1,,2018,1,2360,Pablo,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3300,Effectiveness of a multi-component mHealth intervention to improve post-hospital transitions of care for patients with SMI,"The period immediately following discharge from acute psychiatric hospitalization is a time fraught with gaps and discontinuities in care for many patients. Despite this time of elevated risk, patients often lack sufficient transitional supports and related resources for returning to the community and resuming long-term outpatient treatment. The long-term goal is to improve the continuity of care for patients with serious mental illness (SMI) by supporting a safer and more efficient bridge from hospital to outpatient care. The objective of this proposal is to test the effectiveness of our empirically-supported, multi-component mHealth intervention called tFOCUS in comparison to enhanced assessment and monitoring to ensure safety and an adequate standard of care (""SAFE""). tFOCUS will be deployed during the high-risk period directly from hospital to outpatient care and provide real-time assessment and intervention to patients via a mobile app, plus user engagement and clinical status updates to clinicians via a web-based ""dashboard."" To speed the translation of findings to clinical practice, we will rigorously test the effectiveness of tFOCUS in a fully-powered Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation trial, while collecting information on implementation barriers/facilitators to promote uptake in real world settings. The central hypothesis is that tFOCUS will improve illness self-coping and treatment attitudes, which will lead to reduced: psychiatric symptoms, rehospitalizations, and suicidal ideation/behaviors. tFOCUS will also lead to improved post-discharge treatment engagement and illness recovery. The aims of this proposal are: (1) to conduct a fully-powered, RCT (n=180) to test the effectiveness of treatment-as-usual (TAU) + tFOCUS vs TAU + SAFE; (2) to examine potential mediators and moderators of treatment effects; and, (3) to identify patient, staff, and organizational/system-level factors that may facilitate/hinder tFOCUS implementation. The primary outcome will be overall psychiatric symptoms. The approach is innovative because it is one of the first randomized controlled trials conducted in the U.S. specifically evaluating an mHealth aftercare support program for patients with SMI directly moving from hospital to outpatient care. Also, this study is unique in that it will collect data to generate hypotheses about implementation strategies via a multi-pronged approach involving key stakeholders and additional implementation ata. Upon successful completion of the proposed R01 research, this study will contribute significant actionable data that will lay the groundwork for a large-scale Hybrid Type 3 trial of tFOCUS in diverse hospital settings.",R01,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10502609,R01MH130496,R01MH130496-01,130496,,,2022,1,2370,Chris,,,,,,,,,
3307,Plasmonic mercury sensor and wearable gas detector,"Our proposed project, ""Plasmonic mercury sensor and wearable gas detector,"" will develop a miniaturized and low-cost mercury sensor and apply it to personal exposure monitoring. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of a powerful and sensitive mercury vapor sensor that is less than 0.2 cm3 in volume, draws less than 1 Watt, and costs less than $40 in parts. During this project our sensor will be integrated into a personal monitor to be the first personal mercury monitor that is wearable, immediate, and accurate in complex environments. Newly available integrated optical modules will be employed to measure the plasmonic signal of an amalgam nanoparticle film. Picoyune's proprietary plasmonic mercury sensing technique is uniquely capable of measurements in complex mixtures. The development of such a unique device will benefit all parties concerned with mercury exposure.

3319,Drug Abuse Treatment/Services Research Training Program,"This UCSF postdoctoral training program, entering its 20th year, develops drug abuse treatment and services researchers. The training focuses on four areas: 1) clinical trials of behavioral, psychosocial, and pharmacological interventions, including pilot work that leads to clinical trials; 2) studies of processes that contribute to outcome; 3) efficacy and effectiveness of interventions in real-world settings, and 4) intervention dissemination and diffusion. Trainees are admitted for two years with possibility of a third year. The exceptional trainee may enter for a one-year training program. In the past 19 years the program has successfully trained over 50 doctoral level psychologists, psychiatrists, public health, and policy scientists for academic and research careers. The program's young, trans-disciplinary researchers have embarked on fruitful careers to improve drug abuse treatment through scientific study. In the most recent funding cycle the program had a new director and focused on integration of substance abuse with medical care research in AIDS and other diseases, continuing care for complex patient populations, development of digital-Health intervention platforms, and understanding how health disparities can be ameliorated. During the next five years we appoint a new associate director, focus on linking with nursing in addition to mental health disciplines, conduct rigorous program evaluation, further our emphasis on technology, focus on study of health care reform, and build on our emphasis on HIV care and prevention. The program exists in an environment with relevant resources, including linkages with multiple and diverse clinical sites and a variety of academic centers and activities that supplement the training experience. A six-member Executive Committee of Co-Principal Investigators directs the program, with guidance two groups, a Physician Advisory Committee and a Scientific and Training Advisory Committee. The transdisciplinary core faculty members have backgrounds including psychology, psychiatry, biostatistics, nursing, public health, and epidemiology. Core faculty have strong histories of mentorship, extensive experience in obtaining extramural funding, and ongoing research productivity in drug abuse (including nicotine) treatment and services research. New faculty members have joined the program, bringing important lines of inquiry, research settings, and methods. The result is a resonant environment that allows trainees to draw on multiple perspectives in designing and completing treatment and services research. The expectation is that program graduates will conduct independent methodologically rigorous drug abuse treatment and services research and contribute to the knowledge base in the field.

3320,The Spine Phenome Project: Enabling Technology for Personalized Medicine,"Chronic Low Back Pain (cLBP) is a debilitating condition that affects millions of people globally. Despite increased utilization of interventions and rising medical costs, cLBP prevalence has continued to increase. This problem arises because cLBP is complex, heterogeneous and current diagnostics and treatments rely primarily on subjective metrics and do not target all the multidimensional biopsychosocial mechanisms associated with cLBP. Specifically, most diagnostics do not quantitively consider patient functional measures. This multidisciplinary effort proposes to address this problem by developing and validating a digital health platform and provide meaningful data-driven metrics that enable an integrated approach to clinical evaluation and treatment of cLBP. This platform will facilitate the use of quantitative spinal motion metrics (function), PROs and patient preference information to enable deep patient phenotyping and inform clinical decision-making on personalized treatments in order to improve outcomes. This effort will involve software and hardware development to enable data collection, analysis and visualization in clinical settings. Technology development effort will be done in partnership with Switchbox Inc. (Software Strategy) and Priority Designs Inc. (Regulatory Strategy). The specific aims for UH2 phase are to: 1) Develop a Digital health platform for collecting, analyzing, and reporting core cLBP metrics; 2) Conduct a feasibility study to test the clinical operability, usability and utility of the prototype; and the specific Aims for UH3 phase are to: 1) Optimize Digital Health Platform for translation to clinical research use through BACPAC; 2) Validate the utility of the Digital Health Platform to identify cLBP patient phenotypes and inform clinical decision-making on optimal treatment pathways for individual patients. The outcome of this project will be a digital health platform with data to support regulatory submission for clinical use.

3327,"All About Me: An Intervention to Ease the Transition to Long-term Care, Build Community, and Improve Quality of Care for Persons with Dementia","Given the large number of persons with dementia (PWD) who move into long-term care (LTC) settings each year, and the issues that arise during both this process and their subsequent adaptation to the new living situation, there is a need for a person-centered program to improve both the transition itself and to assist PWD in adapting to their new environment. This Phase I study will involve initial development and evaluation of an innovative cross-platform software app called All About Me (AAM), which will consist of Serious Digital Health Games (SDHGs) for PWD. The AAM App will assist staff in providing person-centered care and enable residents to improve relationships with one another and with staff, thereby promoting a sense of community. The market-ready version of the AAM App will consist of five components. (1) The Fun Facts About Me Game will be used when a PWD is moving into LTC. Family members of PWD will play this game with their relative with dementia. The goal of the game is to provide an enjoyable way for family members and PWD to provide important information about the PWD's social history, personal interests, and care preferences. (2) The Resident Game Bundle will consist of SDHGs that will allow PWD to learn about one another in an enjoyable way. Game content will be automatically created, based upon data collected during the Fun Facts About Me Game. (3) The My Residents Module will provide staff with a convenient way to view information about a PWD with whom they will be working. Staff will launch this module from any device, including a smartwatch in the market-ready version. (4) The Meet the Staff Module, which will be developed and tested in a future Phase II study, will allow residents to learn about staff members at their community, thereby improving relationships between staff members and PWD. (5) The AAM Training Modules will provide staff and family members with access to video-based training modules that describe how to use relevant portions of the app. This Phase I study has three Specific Aims, which will be completed by three project teams over the course of 12 months. Aim 1. Develop an Alpha version of the AAM App. The Software Team and Content Team will work collaboratively to complete Aim 1 during Months 1-7 of the project. They will create (1) The Fun Facts About Me Game and a single Resident Game Bundle game, (2) Two categories of information for the My Residents Module, and (3) Alpha versions of staff and family member Training Modules. Development of the AAM App will be iterative and be informed by Advisory Panels of staff members, family members, and PWD. Aim 2. Examine acceptability of and satisfaction with the AAM App. Aim 3. Examine the impact of the Resident Game Bundle / Survey Says Game on engagement/affect. The Experimental Team will meet Aims 2 and 3 by conducting a quasi-experiment with 24 PWD, 12 Staff, and 24 Family Members during Months 8-11.

3329,"Effect of a Novel, Interactive Mobile APP on Voice Therapy Outcomes and Adherence","Poor patient adherence to treatment limits the effectiveness of behavioral voice therapy. While patients can produce a target voice technique with clinician feedback, they experience adherence failure between therapy sessions characterized by an inability to replicate the target technique independently, forgetting to practice, and forgetting to use the technique all day. Patient self-efficacy (i.e. task-specific confidence) to overcome these challenges is poor. Problem: In our past research, provision of voice therapy videos on mobile MP4 devices significantly increased adherence and self-efficacy (i.e., task-specific confidence), and improved voice outcomes but not significantly so. Therefore, to assist patients in self-evaluating voice technique and remembering to use it, a novel iOS- based software application or ""app"" was developed in our laboratory that provides interactive voice quality feedback (jitter and cepstral peak prominence values), reminds patients to practice, models individualized practice via therapy recordings, and records all practice for direc tracking of adherence (without self-report). Objective: The aims of this project are to test the efficacy of our mobile app in affecting 1) improved voice therapy outcomes and 2) improved adherence and self-efficacy for adherence. Strategy: Sixty adults diagnosed with adducted hyperfunctional voice production and referred for resonant voice therapy at the University of Cincinnati Voice Clinic and Emory Voice Center will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) resonant voice therapy supplemented by standard-of-care written homework instructions or 2) resonant voice therapy supplemented by the mobile voice therapy adherence app. All participants will record their practice on loaned iPods but only half will receive the app. For aim 1, outcome measures (VHI scores, acoustic and perceptual analysis of CAPE-V recordings) will be obtained prior to and following 4 sessions of treatment. For aim 2, adherence will be examined for frequency and duration of patient self-recordings and recordings obtained through app use. Self-efficacy will be tracked weekly through the Voice Therapy Self- Efficacy Scale. Group differences for both aims will be calculated via t-tests, and effects of self-efficacy and adherence on outcomes will be examined with regression analysis. Significance: This project will yield clinical tools and findings that translate directly to clinical voice care, are relevant across speech-language pathology interventions, expand knowledge of adherence and motor learning, and hold potential to increase voice therapy efficacy without increased cost.",R03,DC,NIDCD,DC,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8849888,R03DC013884,R03DC013884-02,13884,,,2015,2,2401,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3356,Using Mobile Technology to Understand and Encourage Mindfulness for Smoking Cessa,"Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Although most smokers indicate interest in quitting, only 6% quit each year. Mindfulness-based interventions show promise for improving smoking cessation; however, underlying mechanisms are unclear. Furthermore, there is a dearth of research on mindfulness and smoking cessation in underserved populations (i.e., members of racial/ethnic minority groups and individuals with low socioeconomic status [SES]), who often have greater difficulty quitting smoking and experience profound tobacco-related health disparities. Mobile health technology (""mHealth"") is revolutionizing healthcare and might be used to elucidate mechanisms underlying mindfulness and enhance mindfulness-based interventions for smoking cessation. Claire Adams, Ph.D., an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the Catholic University of America (CUA), is seeking five years of support through the K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for training and research related to mindfulness, mHealth, advanced statistics, and health disparities research. Dr. Adams' overarching career goals are to inform, develop, evaluate, and disseminate mindfulness- based interventions to promote smoking cessation, prevent cancer and other chronic diseases, and enhance well-being in diverse populations. Through the proposed training plan, Dr. Adams will expand her knowledge and skills with regard to mindfulness, smoking cessation, and health disparities research. In order to fill important gaps in her experience thus far, she will gain specialized training related to mHealth and the advanced statistics necessary for analyzing multi-level and longitudinal data. Dr. Adams will work with her mentoring team (led by Dr. David Wetter and comprising experts in fields of psychology, engineering, public health, and biostatistics) to complete formal coursework, specialized workshops, and directed readings. Primary research aims are to: 1) utilize advanced statistics and mHealth technology to determine mechanisms through which mindfulness influences smoking cessation, and 2) design and test the feasibility of a mHealth-enhanced mindfulness-based intervention for smoking cessation. Toward the first aim, Dr. Adams will learn and apply advanced multilevel modeling techniques to determine mechanisms underlying mindfulness and smoking cessation in three existing datasets that include diverse samples of smokers. Toward the second aim, Dr. Adams will work with her mentoring team to develop and test the feasibility of a mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment that is supplemented by between-session text messaging. This program aims to deliver personalized intervention to participants in their natural environments and in the moments when they might benefit most. Findings from this feasibility study will inform and provide pilot data for an R01 application of a larger randomized controlled trial. Dr. Adams will conduct the proposed work at CUA, which will provide space, time, equipment, and other resources for research and training. The proposed research will be the first known to use mobile technology to examine mechanisms underlying mindfulness and smoking, as well as the first known study to use text messaging to enhance mindfulness- based smoking cessation. Furthermore, all proposed studies will target racially/ethnically diverse and low-SES populations (who are at disproportionate risk for tobacco-related health disparities and have not typically served as participants in mindfulness research). Research findings could be critical in moving forward the scientific study of mindfulness, improving patient outcomes in smoking cessation interventions, preventing cancer and other chronic diseases, and improving quality of life in diverse and underserved populations. The proposed training and research plan would launch Dr. Adams as an independent clinical scientist who conducts multidisciplinary research to inform, develop, evaluate, and disseminate innovative mindfulness- based interventions to improve health in diverse populations.",K23,AT,NCCIH,AT,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8915057,K23AT008442,K23AT008442-02,8442,,,2015,2,2429,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3369,Increasing HPV Vaccine Coverage among Young Adult Gay and Bisexual Men,"Gay and bisexual men have high rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-related disease (e.g., anal cancer) compared to the general population. HPV vaccination is a promising strategy for reducing these existing disparities, as routine HPV vaccination is recommended for young gay and bisexual men (YGBM) through age 26. However, little research has addressed HPV vaccination among YGBM, and no interventions we are aware of have been developed specifically for this high-risk population. To address this important research gap, we conducted a national survey of YGBM ages 18-26 in late 2013. Only about 13% of participants had received any doses of HPV vaccine, and results provided valuable information for designing an HPV vaccine intervention for YGBM. Based on results of this preliminary research, an interdisciplinary research team will conduct the proposed study, ""Increasing HPV Vaccine Coverage among Young Adult Gay and Bisexual Men."" The study will develop and pilot test a theoretically-based mobile health (mHealth) HPV vaccine intervention for YGBM that will consist of: 1) population-targeted, individually-tailored content about HPV and HPV vaccine; and 2) vaccination reminders. During pilot testing, the intervention will be compared to a control group that receives standard information about HPV and HPV vaccine via a mobile-friendly website. The study will have two primary aims and an exploratory aim. Aim 1 will develop and pilot test the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention for YGBM to establish intervention feasibility and acceptability. Feasibility will be established by meeting recruitment (n=94) and retention (85% retention over a 6-month follow-up period) goals for the pilot study, and acceptability will be established by comparing participant satisfaction with study materials between the intervention and control groups. Aim 2 will obtain preliminary efficacy data on whether the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention increases HPV vaccine initiation compared to the control group. HPV vaccine initiation (i.e., receipt of the first dose of the three-dose HPV vaccine series) will serve as the primary outcome for the pilot study. An exploratory aim will examine whether the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention affects secondary outcomes compared to the control group. Secondary outcomes will include receipt of the second and third doses of the HPV vaccine series and changes in potential mediators between study group and HPV vaccination. Results from the pilot study will establish intervention feasibility and acceptability and provide valuable preliminary data on outcomes related to HPV vaccination. These data will inform an R01 grant application to test the efficacy of the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention in a large randomized controlled trial.",R21,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8869419,R21CA194831,R21CA194831-01,194831,,,2015,1,2443,Chris,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3382,Optimizing HIV care for patients with substance use disorders using predictive analytics in a mobile health application,"It is now well-accepted that lowering community viral load through scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce HIV transmission among people who use drugs. However, achieving durable viral suppression among patients with substance use disorders is a major challenge for clinical providers and health systems. Patients with substance use disorders are continuously at risk for relapse and other disruptive life events. This can lead to frequent lapses in antiretroviral treatment and subsequent viral rebound, which increases the risk of health problems related to HIV and the risk of transmitting HIV to others. This project addresses the problem of lapses in antiretroviral treatment by testing the effectiveness of an innovative mobile health (mHealth) system designed to support people living with HIV and substance use disorders who are receiving HIV care. The mHealth intervention, called A-CHESS, is an evidence-based smartphone application previously shown to reduce substance use and improve retention in addiction treatment by improving social connectedness, intrinsic motivation and coping competence. In this 2-stage, crossover clinical trial, we will provide smartphones running the A-CHESS application to 150 HIV-positive patients who have a past-year history of alcohol, opioid, or stimulant use disorder. In the first phase, participants will use the A-CHESS application to report data in real time describing their drug use, mood, social support, and other factors during a 6-month ecologic momentary assessment (EMA) study. These data will be used to develop and validate a predictive model of treatment non-adherence in this population. After 6 months, all patients will cross over to the second study phase, during which the full, multi-component, tailored mHealth intervention will be delivered using the A-CHESS platform. Simultaneously, data captured by A-CHESS describing participants' risk of treatment lapse will be communicated to patient's providers and clinical support staff, allowing timely and focused support interventions. The effectiveness of the intervention for improving the rate of viral suppression will be assessed using a mixed effects logistic regression model. This project has the potential for high impact because it identifies the critical time-varying determinants of lapses in HIV care for substance using patients, and translates these diverse inputs into actionable, patient-specific alerts to clinical providers.",DP2,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9180574,DP2DA042424,DP2DA042424-01,42424,,,2016,1,2456,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
3411,Using Wearable Technology to Assess Recovery and Detect Post-Operative Complications Following Cardiothoracic Surgery,"Every year, more than 500,000 patients undergo operations for heart and lung disease. After surgery, patients often experience pain, fatigue, and disturbed sleep that can persist for weeks to months. In addition, up to 32% of patients develop postoperative complications, which often occur after discharge from the hospital and may lead to readmission. Complications are costly and can be deadly; they are associated with a 200-300% increase in healthcare costs and a 6-fold increase in 90-day postoperative mortality. Currently, after surgery, when a patient is discharged from the hospital, the patient and their family members are responsible for monitoring the patient's health status. Patients are usually not seen by a doctor for 2-4 weeks after discharge. Attempts to improve postoperative monitoring include home health visits and telemedicine approaches. However, these methods have been shown to be ineffective, costly, and allow for only vague and intermittent assessments of recovery. They do not detect complications until they are at a more severe stage. As such, accurate, easy-to-implement and inexpensive methods to assess postoperative recovery and to detect complications at their earliest stage-before symptom onset-are urgently needed. We previously showed that machine learning analysis of biometrics collected by wearables could detect Lyme Disease and Covid-19. We then, in a pilot study, applied our algorithm, previously developed to identify Covid- 19, to patients undergoing thoracic surgery and showed that this algorithm could detect 89% of complications a median of 3 days before symptom onset. When we evaluated the postoperative recovery of cardiothoracic patients, we showed that machine learning analysis of biometrics could classify patients into distinct recovery groups. Thus, wearables and machine learning algorithms could lead to a highly accurate and accessible method to predict complications early and improve assessments of recovery. Our overall objective is to optimize and validate our machine learning algorithm-previously developed for the early detection of Covid-19-for the detection of postoperative complications prior to symptom onset and to use machine learning analysis to predict the quality of a patient's recovery using pre- and intraoperative data. Our project aims to first use wearables to collect high-resolution physiologic data of cardiothoracic surgical patients. We will then extend our previously developed algorithm for early detection of postoperative complications and develop an algorithm to predict the quality of a patient's postoperative recovery. The proposed project will develop an innovative method to detect postoperative complications prior to symptom onset and predict the quality of a patient's postoperative recovery using pre- and intraoperative data. Importantly, our proposed method could be scaled to not only improve outcomes for cardiothoracic surgical patients, but for patients undergoing other types of surgery. The results of this study will enable a future randomized trial that evaluates whether real-time postoperative monitoring with machine learning algorithms and wearables can lead to 1) earlier detection of complications, 2) earlier outpatient interventions that improve recovery and/or reduce severity of complications, and 3) decreases in unplanned hospital readmissions.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10522199,R01HL159170,R01HL159170-01A1,159170,A1,,2022,1,2486,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
3413,MOBILE HEALTH INTERVENTION FOR FAMILY SMOKING CESSATION IN ROMANIA,"Tobacco cigarette smoking remains the leading global cause of preventable disease and death killing near- ly 6 million people each year, with most of these deaths occurring in low and middle income countries (LMICs). The potential of mHealth, especially mobile phone-based strategies, to transform health care, change health behaviors, and improve health has particular significance for LMICs where access to health providers and care is limited. Preconception and pregnancy smoking are high in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) with life- time negative health effects for the women and their children. There are higher odds of female smoking persis- tence during pregnancy, as well as relapse once pregnant women quit, when the male partner also smokes. It is critically important to address the smoking behavior of couples during their reproductive life. Building on our work in Romania and other CEE countries, the objectives of this application are to deter- mine in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) whether a mHealth couples intervention shows promise in increas- ing smoking cessation among pregnant couples who smoke and to build mHealth research capacity in Roma- nia. We will build on Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Motivational Interviewing (MI), a counselling style that is successful in assisting people to quit smoking. The intervention will be novel in its use of the unique functionality of smartphones, its emphasis on the dyadic efficacy for smoking cessation, and the focus on pregnant couples. Our aims are to (1) Test the implementation feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a culturally-adapted mHealth smoking cessation intervention among couples during pregnancy and postpartum in Romania. We will recruit 60 pregnant smokers and their partners; (2) Develop mHealth research capacity by enhancing individual and institutional research capabilities in Romania and expanding the existing international research network. The study will generate a base of preliminary evidence that can be used to launch a large scale R01 pro- ject to test the effectiveness of the proposed smoking prevention intervention. With respect to expected out- comes, the proposed application is anticipated to advance understanding of the effectiveness of a proactive mHealth couple intervention enhanced by addressing couples' dyadic efficacy for smoking cessation in reduc- ing pregnancy smoking and postnatal relapse. Such results are anticipated to have a system wide sustainable positive impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal family smoking as the intervention has a high po- tential to be adopted in the universal health system in Romania, with applications to the US and other popula- tions. This research is also expected to have a significant impact on the methodology and design of mHealth interventions during the reproductive years. The development of the international research network and the individual and institutional mHealth research capacity building is expected to positively impact mHealth re- search in CEE and the neighboring region applied to tobacco control and other locally-relevant topics.",R21,TW,FIC,TW,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9340349,R21TW010896,R21TW010896-01,10896,,,2018,1,2488,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3426,A Predictive Model for Assessment of CSF Flow Through Ventricular Shunts,"Hydrocephalus is a crippling condition which caused by an aberrant draining capacity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain, affecting about 1-5 of every 1000 live births. This debilitating condition commonly manifests itself in frequent headaches, seizures, and comas, with death as a likely outcome when left untreated. The standard of care to alleviate this condition is ventriculoperitoneal shunting which diverts CSF away from the brain ventricles, thereby reducing excess pressure build-up. CSF diversion systems or shunts are typically rudimentary systems which contain a ventricular catheter, valve, and drainage tubing; this technology has experienced minimal innovation since the 1960s. However, shunts regularly fail and require correction surgeries due to obstructions and occlusions, leading to over 125,000 shunt revisions in the United States annually. Shunt revisions cost about 2 billion dollars in the United States annually for the nearly 1 million affected Americans. Hydrocephalus imposes a huge financial, physiological, and psychological burden on patients and their health care providers, emphasizing the urgent need to improve methods of monitoring and prediction of shunt failure. To compound this issue, existing shunt failure diagnostics are costly, invasive, and/or harmful (in the case of ex- tended radiation exposure in CT imaging). Typical shunt testing modalities include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Coherence Tomography (CT), and X-rays. Due to patient-to-patient variability in age, pathology, shunt in- termittency, and shunt valve type, there is currently a lack of data with regards to flow dynamics in CSF diversion systems. Most research efforts have primarily focused on the development of 'smart shunts' which inadvertently couples complete shunt failure to sensor failure; this proposal seeks to provide accurate and real-time monitoring of CSF flow in a noninvasive manner, the success of which could directly affect the quality of life of 1 million Americans suffering with hydrocephalus and millions more around the world. This proposal will support the devel- opment of a wearable sensor platform and processing algorithm that will culminate in a predictive model of shunt failure to reduce hospital admissions and improve the quality of life for patients with hydrocephalus. Success of this proposal will yield a fully flexible, soft, and wireless system which monitors CSF diversion (Aim 1 and Aim 2), leading to a validation trial of the integrated system in long term trials of both adult and pediatric patients suffering with hydrocephalus. The completion of this work will also include the generation of a predictive model which allows researchers to study long term CSF flow dynamics through ventricular shunts (Aim 3). Ultimately, our methodology will enable us to collect a wealth of information to significantly aid healthcare professionals in the proactive treatment of the devastating symptoms of hydrocephalus.",F31,NS,NINDS,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,6,1,No,Awarded,9992053,F31NS115422,F31NS115422-01A1,115422,A1,,2020,1,2501,Pablo,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3446,Measuring Real-Time Influences of Mental and Tangible Resources on Men's TB Treatment Lapses and Adherence Behaviors,"In 2018, approximately 10 million people developed TB disease globally, of which men aged ≥15 years accounted for over 50% of the cases. South African national TB prevalence studies have reported that men had a higher burden of TB, a lower case detection and larger reporting gaps compared to women. An analysis of South Africa's TB care cascade revealed that only 53% of TB patients completed treatment. Most strikingly, TB in South Africa is responsible for a large proportion of the difference in life expectancy between men and women. For South Africa to contribute to the End TB Strategy target of halving TB incidence by 2025, it is imperative to implement effective interventions to support engagement and retention in TB care, especially among men. This study will develop a method to gather factors and resources influencing TB treatment in real-time, by integrating modified ecological momentary assessments (mEMA) with medication event-monitoring system (MEMS) and assessing its feasibility. This study will be conducted over two aims. In Aim 1, we will integrate EMA and MEMS and then determine functionality and usability. This aim will be conducted over two phases. In Phase 1, the research study team will integrate the Wisepill technology (MEMS) with REDCap and conduct a functionality simulation with study staff. In Phase 2, a usability assessment of the mEMA-MEMS platform will be conducted with 20 participants, 10 men and 10 women. This phase will involve a think-aloud method and 30-day test using the mEMA-MEMS platform with a study mobile phone. Findings will inform the final mEMA-MEMS platform for Aim 2. In Aim 2, we will conduct an observational cohort study with 60 participants (30 men and 30 women) initiating TB treatment. All participants will be trained on how to use the mEMA-MEMS platform and provided a study mobile phone. Every 28 days, they will return to the clinic study site to refill their Wisepill with medication. During the study, each participant will receive random and event mEMAs based on their dosing behaviors. Participants will be interviewed at enrollment, during continuation and post-continuation stages of treatment, to assess feasibility, acceptability, willingness and safety using interviews and surveys. We will also collect preliminary data to understand psychosocial and contextual factors influential in TB treatment across the continuum, results will be used to inform subsequent study design. The results of this study will inform a larger R01 observational study that will determine what resources are needed at particular times during treatment to support adherence, and determine what resources are generalizable to all and distinctive for men such that an intervention may be developed and tested to support their adherence and TB treatment outcomes.",R21,AI,NIAID,AI,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10287506,R21AI163977,R21AI163977-01,163977,,,2021,1,2521,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3455,Enhancing transdiagnostic mechanisms of cognitive dyscontrol using computer-based training,"Mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders are common psychiatric conditions - affecting over 40 million U.S. adults - and are leading causes of disability worldwide. People with these conditions are commonly plagued by difficulty controlling distressing personal thoughts and memories, collectively referred to as repetitive negative thinking symptoms. Models suggest that repetitive negative thinking is driven by executive functioning deficits, such that cognitive resources are insufficient to downregulate unwanted thoughts. Executive functioning deficits could be a promising treatment target but are not typically addressed with existing interventions. The long-term goal advanced by this proposal is to develop effective, mechanistic cognitive training programs that can improve cognition and reduce symptoms associated with mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders. The objectives of this proposal are first to determine the optimal dose of a cognitive training program designed to improve executive functioning in this population using behavioral and neural outcomes (R61). If the cognitive training tested in the R61 successfully improves executive functioning (go/no-go decision), we will evaluate the relationship between change in executive functioning and change in clinical symptoms (R33). Our central hypothesis is that repeated training exercises will enhance executive functioning and will lead to a reduction of repetitive negative thinking in mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders. The hypothesis will be tested by pursing two specific aims: Aim 1 is to identify the cognitive effects and optimal dose of cognitive training. Aim 2 is to evaluate the clinical effects of the optimized cognitive training program relative to a sham condition. We will also conduct an exploratory aim to determine generalization of cognitive training to real-world cognitive performance. The R61 phase will test Aim 1 by randomizing participants with depression, anxiety, and/or traumatic stress disorders to one of two doses of cognitive training or a no-treatment control condition. We will examine executive functioning change with cognitive task performance and functional neuroimaging assessments. The R33 phase will randomize participants to the dose decided by the R61 or a sham condition. The R33 intends to replicate the impact on executive functioning and assess the relationship between change in executive functioning and clinical symptoms. We will explore how cognitive training helps people in their daily lives by including assessments given with a smartphone mobile cognitive testing app. The research proposed is innovative because it aims to address symptoms by intervening on a cognitive target thought to generate symptoms across multiple disorders, thus explicitly testing the interactions of cognitive and emotional symptoms. Outcomes derived from the proposed research will include a novel treatment program and information about its utility for reducing clinical symptoms. Knowledge from this proposal will advance our treatment options by targeting a specific cognitive system, providing a foundation for neuroscience-based therapeutic alternative for symptoms that span mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders.",R61,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10283150,R61MH127005,R61MH127005-01,127005,,,2021,1,2531,Chris,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3456,Community Partnership for Telehealth Solutions to Counter Misinformation and Achieve Equity (PRIME),"Use of cancer screening services for Latinx populations has lagged far behind the use for non-Latinx White populations; this has led to later stage detection and worse survival for Latinx people. Clinic-delivered video- texting combined with neighborhood-level navigation services is a telehealth-community solution that offers great promise for addressing cancer screening disparities, as it reduces multi-level barriers to care. Our proposed project, Community Partnership for Telehealth Solutions to Counter Misinformation and Achieve Equity (PRIME), will leverage partnerships among research centers, clinics, and community organizations to provide personalized support services informed by local knowledge and neighborhood-level data, and apply and evaluate novel technical and communication solutions. The goal of PRIME will be to improve colorectal cancer-related care delivery and reduce disparities in telehealth access and care by developing and testing telehealth tools and technologies using novel research methods. This research will use rapid methods and adaptive-evaluation processes and will apply the Health Equity Implementation Framework and components of the Reach Effectiveness-Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, with an emphasis on effects on disparities in implementation and evaluation. PRIME will assess neighborhood-level social determinants of health and adapt and optimize a telehealth-solution to improve the quality, reach, and effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening in predominantly Latinx clinic populations aged 45-54 (Aim 1); test technical and communication solutions that use video-text messages to educate patients about colorectal cancer screening, link them to community-based services, and provide personalized navigation to support to improve uptake of screening and follow-up care, using a pragmatic stepped-wedge design (12 neighborhoods; 3,000 patients aged 45-54; Aim 2); and assess multi-level moderators of program effectiveness (including neighborhood-level social determinants of health, ethnicity, and preferred language) and organizational-level barriers and facilitators to implementation; and scale-up the program across neighborhoods and partnering clinical practice sites (n = 4; Aim 3). This project will leverage local resources and strengthen connections among health systems and trusted community-based organizations, increasing the likelihood of program sustainment. To ensure the project's success, we have assembled an engaged group of community partners, including payers, health centers, community-based organizations, and patients, along with a multi-disciplinary research team of nationally renowned clinicians and scientists. If successful, the program will result in ready-to- implement strategies to reduce cancer-related disparities and improve preventive cancer care access, quality, and health outcomes for Latinx populations.",R01,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10608871,R01MD018253,R01MD018253-01,18253,,,2022,1,2532,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3461,Real-time quantification of muscle-tendon dynamics for individualized and adaptive robot-assisted locomotion,"Walking function has a critical role in life functions and health. According to the Americans with Disability: 2010 report from the US Census Bureau, roughly 30.6 million individuals aged 15 years and older had limitations associated with ambulation including difficulty walking. These limitations represent a significant healthcare, societal and economic problem, as these people are at risk of developing co-morbidities, rapidly declining health, and face significant challenges associated with integrating into the community and rejoining the workforce. Impaired ankle function is thought to be a major contributing factor to the reduced gait function in elderly and stoke survivors. Recent results suggest that ankle-assisting exosuits can improve gait after stroke. The Biodesign Lab has developed new soft exoskeleton systems (""exosuits"") that are constructed from compliant materials such as fabrics and transmit force from small actuator packs to ankle and hip joints. By triggering actuation to assist the user at carefully-selected phases of the gait cycle, these systems demonstrably reduce the energetic cost of locomotion and can help correct pathological gait. Compared to traditional rigid exoskeletons, these systems are lightweight, comfortable, and do not hinder normal joint motions. Numerous studies have confirmed that wearable ankle exoskeletons or exosuits can significantly lower the metabolic cost of locomotion and promote more effective gait. However, individual benefit varies widely and the assistance parameters (e.g. applied joint torque, timing) that work well for some individuals are counterproductive for others. State-of-the-art techniques such as empirical optimization are successful in finding the metabolic optimum but are time intensive and often limited to the gait condition tested. Additionally, these methods so far fail to provide a mechanistic explanation for differences in individual response which could be used to improve exosuit design and function. This proposal targets a new approach for quickly individualizing assistance through the development of low- profile and portable ultrasound imaging technology that can visualize and measure the behavior of muscles and tendons within the leg. The hypothesis is that direct measurement of the dynamics of the plantarflexor muscle- tendon unit (MTU) using ultrasound imaging will provide essential insight into the mechanisms that underlie human interaction with exosuit assistance. Furthermore, signals derived from MTU dynamics can enable effective individualized and adaptive exosuit assistance in diverse gait conditions. This developmental R21 project will result in the creation and validation of a system to measure the state of important MTU parameters in the leg during exosuit operation. The rich biomechanics dataset will provide insights into user response and will be made available to researchers. The preliminary work with elderly individuals will provide the framework for extending the potential of exosuit technology to a broader range of clinical users where assistive strategies are customized to the user and the demands of real-world locomotion.",R21,AR,NIAMS,AR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10057301,R21AR076686,R21AR076686-01A1,76686,A1,,2020,1,2537,Chris,,,,,,,,,
3468,"EXpanding Technology-Enabled, Nurse-Delivered Chronic Disease Care (EXTEND)","When the self-management demands of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension exceed patients' self-management capacity, poor control ensues. For many patients, clinic-based chronic disease care provides insufficient self-management support, resulting in clinic-refractory chronic diseases. As an example, 12% of all patients with type 2 diabetes maintain a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥8.5% for ≥1 year despite clinic-based care; this is defined as 'persistent poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus' (PPDM). PPDM does not respond to clinic- based care because the factors that underlie PPDM are not well-addressed with the infrequent patient-provider contact achievable in clinic. Importantly, over 85% of patients with PPDM have comorbid hypertension, which further exacerbates outcomes in this high-risk group. Without better treatment options, patients with PPDM and hypertension will inevitably accrue preventable complications and costs. Telehealth has the potential to improve management of clinic-refractory chronic diseases relative to clinic- based care alone because it facilitates patient-provider contact and better supports self-management. Our prior work shows that nurse-delivered telehealth interventions incorporating telemonitoring, self-management support, and medication management can lower HbA1c even among clinic-refractory patients with PPDM. Excitingly, emerging mobile monitoring technologies could enhance telehealth for clinic-refractory chronic diseases, either by generating multiple streams of health data to facilitate patient self-management, or by integrating mobile monitoring data into a nurse-delivered telehealth intervention. However, key evidence gaps currently prevent use of mobile monitoring-enabled telehealth in clinical practice. The current proposal, EXpanding Technology-Enabled, Nurse-Delivered Chronic Disease Care (EXTEND) seeks to address current barriers and evidence gaps preventing practical use of mobile monitoring-enabled telehealth for clinic-refractory chronic disease, using PPDM with comorbid hypertension as the target condition. Because this population has already proven refractory to usual clinic care, this study proposes an active comparator randomized trial (N=220) comparing the effectiveness of two 12-month telehealth interventions: 1) EXTEND-Monitoring, or mobile monitoring alone; and 2) EXTEND-Nursing, a nurse-delivered intervention incorporating mobile monitoring, self-management support, and medication management. In order to guide further scaling and dissemination of the EXTEND interventions, a rigorous, multi-method evaluation will: (A) interview stakeholders regarding implementation barriers and facilitators; and (B) compare intervention costs against potential reimbursement mechanisms. Finally, the value of combining data from mobile monitoring and electronic health records to predict patient safety events will be examined in the cohort over 24 months. Clinic-refractory chronic diseases demand innovation to reduce preventable complications.

3491,mHealth app for caregiver instruction in manual therapy for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy,"Chemotherapy can damage nervous system structures leading to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) which impairs quality of life and daily functioning for millions of cancer survivors. Some 30% of recipients live with CIPN chronically beyond completion of chemotherapy. Conventional care is symptomatic including antidepressants, anticonvulsants, analgesics, vitamin supplements and topical gels to manage symptoms. While there are no FDA-approved treatments, evidence indicates that specific manual therapy techniques can reduce symptoms of CIPN. There is also evidence that caregivers can learn safe and effective manual therapy techniques for use in caregiving through multimedia instruction. However, there currently is no caregiver education product teaching specific techniques and safety precautions pertaining to CIPN. This project will develop a mobile health (mHealth) app to empower caregivers with knowledge, skills, self-efficacy and motivation to support loved ones with CIPN by use of simple manual techniques based on specific understanding and safety precautions for CIPN. The project will use a human-centered design approach in formative research to develop a ""minimum viable product (MVP)"" for the eventual caregiver mHealth app. A user-centered, iterative process with caregiver focus groups will guide development of the MVP which will then be assessed for feasibility through a Think-Aloud protocol. Specific Aims are as follows: Aim 1. Develop initial user-centered app design. We will develop preliminary requirements for core educational content to be featured in the app, then refine this with patient focus group feedback. The resulting initial app design will incorporate principles of ease of navigation, usability, utility, and engagement. Aim 2. Refine app design through an iterative process of qualitative feedback. The initial app design will be processed and revised through three rounds of caregiver focus groups for qualitative feedback and refinement. Qualitative analysis of responses after each round will be conducted, and applied to produce revised versions through round 3, resulting in the MVP prototype. Aim 3. Evaluate usability of a minimum viable product (MVP). Caregivers will experience the MVP prototype through an interactive Think-Aloud session with the design team that is recorded for qualitative analysis. This will be followed by debriefing with structured interview questions about design, relevance and intent to use. Quantitative data will assess system usability, and perceived relevance and impact on caregiving. Feasibility criteria will be usability scores and user ratings of perceived value and ""intent to use"" in caregiving. If Phase I is successful the app will be completed in Phase II followed by a large RCT to assess outcomes of use for both CIPN sufferers and caregivers. Eventual public health benefits include improved quality of life and functional well-being for the population of CIPN sufferers, reduced caregiver burden, and reduced economic burden from medical costs and lost productivity associated with CIPN.",R43,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10482557,R43CA268678,R43CA268678-01A1,268678,A1,,2022,1,2569,Chris,,,,,,,,,
3497,Project FIGARO - Factors Important to Gather for Anticipating Relapses for Opioids,"For individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) the propensity for relapse is high when experiencing craving, independent of a desire to stay sober. Historically, tools to fight opioid addiction have been limited and retrospective. By the time a traditional intervention occurs, they are often already reusing. Addiction relapses too often lead to a costly downward spiral - committing crimes, getting rearrested, being hospitalized, overdosing, and/or dying. Recent advances in wearable sensors, smartphones and artificial intelligence have created an unprecedented opportunity to produce positive health outcomes by predicting and preventing OUD relapses and overdoses. With sensing and associated algorithms, it will be possible to detect relapse risk states and intervene in advance - before a relapse actually occurs. The first step in this new era of proactive opioid relapse prediction is to identify and measure digital biomarkers associated with reinitiating drug use and relapse and implement a predictive model with minimal false positive alerts to achieve just-in-time intervention. This will begin with the collection of quantitative and qualitative data on patients and healthcare professionals to identify desired features and functions. Behaivior LLC will develop a relapse prevention platform that will consider a combination of physiological sensor data from the patient's wearable devices in combination with smartphone usage data, location data and - importantly - reports from people in his/her support network to identify and detect relapse triggers in real-time. SA-1​: Demonstrate what makes a wrist wearable device acceptable and usable for people with OUD. SA-2.A​: Identify positive correlations between physiological, location and smartphone data, and self-reported opioid cravings: ​Results will be used to create a predictive model that can operate in real-time. SA-2.B​: Demonstrate feasibility of using support-network-reported data to predict opioid cravings. SA-3​: Create a predictive model to anticipate opioid relapse as a step towards just-in-time intervention. SA-4​: Demonstrate feasibility of predictive model by obtaining a sufficiently low false positive rate. A successful outcome of this project will be a wearables platform capable of predicting and preventing opioid addiction relapses, stemming the tide of the opioid epidemic. The platform will be ready for regulatory approvals and integration into existing electronic health records and monitoring systems. To achieve behavior modification, Behaivior will implement and commercialize a wearables platform and suite of effective interventions utilizing individualized, active machine learning, and continued iteration of next generation wearables and supporting mobile applications. ​A​ robust platform prototype capable of producing measurable change will be tested.

3502,Web App Technology for Boys and Parents: Improving HPV Vaccine Uptake,"The President's Cancer Advisory Board and the Centers for Disease Control have called for renewed efforts in promoting vaccination for Human Papillomavirus (HPV), including vaccination for adolescent boys, because the uptake of this new vaccine remains alarmingly low. Currently, less than 15% of adolescent boys have received the HPV vaccine; thus, most of this population remains at risk for oropharyngeal, anal, and penile cancers. Many parents remain unconvinced of the safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccines, so effective and accessible messaging to improve decision-making on this vaccine is needed. Parents of adolescent boys also have different concerns about HPV vaccination than for adolescent girls, creating a need for unique health communication interventions to promote vaccine uptake among boys. Interventions also need to address the unique challenges of minority populations and populations for whom English is not the first language. A novel digital intervention will be produced and evaluated for its ability to improve HPV vaccine outcomes. Specifically, a mobile responsive web application (""mobile web app"") will be created that performs similar to a mobile app but runs on a variety of computing platforms from personal desktop and laptop computers to the latest smart phones and tablet computers. Mobile web app content will be targeted to parents and adolescent boys aged 11-13 years living in New Mexico, a majority-minority population with large proportions of Hispanics, Whites, and Native Americans. The specific aims are to: 1) carefully and systematically develop a mobile web app (BoyVac) for smart phones, tablet computers, and personal computers that will utilize Diffusion of Innovations principles to provide targeted information concerning HPV vaccine adoption to adolescent males and their parents, particularly minority adolescents and parents; 2) implement a comprehensive and rigorous test of the impact of the BoyVac mobile web app intervention on HPV vaccine adoption outcomes via a randomized efficacy trial (BoyVac v. usual and customary care); and 3) examine the dose-response relationships between mobile web app usage and vaccine outcomes within a components analysis. A group-randomized pretest-posttest controlled design will be implemented, recruiting 1800 pairs of parents and adolescent boys from 30 pediatric clinics (n=60 parents and boys per clinic) affiliated with the Envision New Mexico, a best practices program at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center's Department of Pediatrics. Parents will be surveyed at baseline, a 3-month follow-up, and a 9-month follow-up and records HPV vaccination adoption for the boys will be obtained from the clinics' medical records at the 9- month follow-up. Analyses will test the hypotheses that 1) more 11-13 year old boys in the intervention group (BoyVac mobile web app) will adopt the HPV vaccine than boys in the usual and customary care comparison group and 2) adoption of HPV vaccine will be mediated by improvements in theoretical mediators among parents in the intervention compared to the usual and customary care comparison group.",R01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9175948,R01CA210125,R01CA210125-01A1,210125,A1,,2016,1,2580,Chris,,,,,,,,,
3511,Capturing Control Dynamics Via Eye-Movements: General and Age-Comparative Analyse,"Cognitive control over perception, thought, and action allows us to stay on task by keeping irrelevant information at bay. Whether control is successful or not largely depends on its dynamic properties. It needs to respond promptly to upcoming challenges, such as the need for flexible change, or to critical triggering events, such as the experience of conflict, but it also needs to be able to profit from past control events. Deficits i dynamic control are linked to prevalent clinical disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactiviy disorder, schizophrenia, or depressive symptoms. Moreover, control dynamics change across the adult life span in ways that are not well understood and that become particularly relevant in multi-tasking situations. In order to fully understand both intact and deficient control we need to track how the dynamics of control actually unfold over time. One central claim of this application is that eye tracking combined with adequate experimental paradigms and analytic techniques can provide dynamic information with the necessary precision. With these analytic tools, we examine here the general hypothesis that local control dynamics are profoundly affected global control settings. Specifically, we propose that control operates either in a maintenance mode, emphasizing stable behavioral patterns, or in an updating mode, emphasizing flexible change. Furthermore, we hypothesize that older adults' specific difficulties in multi-tasking situations arise from on overuse of the updating mode, which in turn has pervasive ""down-stream"" effects on local control phenomena. Using our eye-tracking based analytic tools; we test these general hypotheses in three different ways. First, we look at the precise short-term and longer-term temporal dynamics of adopting attentional settings and how these dynamics change as a function of control modes and age. Second, we examine for the first time how exactly interruptions affect cognitive activity in young and old adults. Third, we use eye-movements to directly assess when individuals engage in updating, thus allowing us to determine both antecedents and consequences of updating operations, as well as why older adults often dramatically over-engage in updating. Thus, this work addresses substantive questions about flexible control of thought and action and about the nature of age differences therein, but also brings a new set of methodological tools to the study of control. These tools will substantially enhance the precision with which researchers can capture the dynamic nature of control. Multitasking and interruptions are an omnipresent reality in the way we use modern digital media. Difficulties with multitasking in older adults contribute to the emerging digital divide, potentially constraining seniors' societal participation or access to important health-care tools. The information gained in this project will be useful for the design of multi-task environments or targeted training procedures.",R01,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,9088249,R01AG037564,R01AG037564-04,37564,,,2016,4,2589,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
3515,Translating Energy Balance From Bench to Communities: Application of Parallel Animal-Human Studies in Cancer,"This application is for partial support of a national conference hosted by the Center for Energy Balance in Cancer Prevention and Survivorship at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, ""Translating Energy Balance From Bench to Communities: Application of Parallel Animal-Human Studies in Cancer."" This conference will be held October 8-10, 2020 at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX. As members of the energy balance and cancer research community, we have observed that some of the most successful bench to clinic translation occurs when transdisciplinary researchers perform parallel studies in which mechanistic studies in animal models inform clinical or population studies, and vice versa. A major need within the energy balance community is a forum for discussions based on clear examples of successful parallel studies, as well as frank discussion about the level of evidence needed in animal and clinical research to compel clinical practice change. This conference will help to meet that need by achieving the following aims: (1) Facilitate discussion among energy balance researchers about the translation of data between animal research, clinical care and population sciences, with emphasis on the level of evidence needed for paradigm change: Create a critical mass of researchers in these disciplines to participate in focused and constructive discussions; (2) Promotion of collaborative science: Promote multi-disciplinary discussion and collaboration building; (3) Career development: Provide career development to early stage investigators via group training sessions and to mid-career and senior investigators via individual career coaching sessions. The conference is designed to engage participants through moderated discussions as part of each of four plenary sessions: nutrition, physical activity or exercise, body composition, and controversies in clinical practice. Each plenary session has a speaker who is focused on animal research, one focused on clinical research, and one who performs parallel animal-human research, emphasizing the synergism between animal and human studies. Trainees and early stage investigators will benefit from one-on-one career counseling at the poster session and during lunch, as well as from a specific aims workshop and an educational session on communicating with colleagues in disparate fields on day three. Also on day three, a series of ""hot topics"" sessions will cover big data/genomics, immunology, microbiome, metabolomics, use of wearables to track activity, and clinical feeding study design. Here, we propose all of the components of a dynamic, impactful conference including keynote speakers from international leaders Melinda Irwin, PhD, MPH and Steven Hursting, PhD, MPH, several opportunities for audience participation through moderated discussions, and curated sessions which aim to highlight the powerful synergism of parallel animal-human studies in energy balance and cancer research.",R13,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10070305,R13CA254014,R13CA254014-01,254014,,,2020,1,2593,Josh,,,,,,,,,

Application type: K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award. Career development aim: Develop skills in the evaluation, development, and implementation of health IT solutions to improve the safety of care in CKD through a unique didactic curriculum and execution of a novel prospective study plan. Study aims: 1) examine the association between surveyed perceived e-literacy and medication errors in individuals with CKD, 2) assess the relationship between functional computer literacy and medication errors in individuals with CKD using performance assessment of a simple website-based task list, and 3) pilot a novel IT prototype medication inquiry system (MIS) which provides precautionary information on the safe usage medications common in CKD. Core study and population: Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study, which is a nationally cohort of adult participants with CKD. Research methods: Aim 1: Survey CRIC participants from 4 CRIC sites (n=1150) at an annual visit regarding their mobile phone usage, and perceived e-health literacy with the validated eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS). Aim 2: Assess the human-computer interactions of participants at three CRIC centers (n=195) accessing an ""eCRIC' website and a structured assignment list, designed to measure participants' computer proficiency. Evaluate the association between Aims 1 & 2 measures and degree of cumulative threat to safety defined by a novel medication error classification scheme. Aim 3: evaluate local CRIC participants (n = 50) effective use of a novel MIS application embedded on a personal digital assistant-based (e.g. iPod Touch""), which notifies users about the safety of specific medications upon input of their actual medications with CAUTION or NOT SAFE alerts. Correctness of reported results will be verified by study staff. Career development plan: Multidisciplinary mentorship team and curriculum has been assembled to foster Dr. Diamantidis' working knowledge of healthcare informatics, patient engagement methodology, and mobile technology applications.

3538,"Using technology-enhanced approaches to advance cancer health equity among diverse deaf, deafblind, and hard of hearing populations.","About 500,000 use American Sign Language (ASL). Among DDBHH people who use ASL, there are documented reports of difficulties in understanding cancer health information in print, accessing clinical services for screenings, and understanding and following treatment-related directives if the screening results warrant a cancer diagnosis. These difficulties contribute to the health inequity that we observed in the DDBHH populations. Community health workers have proven their value with hearing patients, so it is reasonable to expect that ASL- proficient community health workers (CHW) will have the same potential to identify and resolve DDBHH people's barriers to receiving optimal care for cancer prevention and screening. We envision an ASL-proficient CHW, functioning as a cancer health navigator, who is able to promote cancer screening adherence and reduce health disparity among DDBHH people. This research will build on the team's current NIH-funded research and recently developed technology platform, specifically SNAP (the System for Navigational Assistance for Patients), a technology to support cancer patient navigators, and REPEAT (Realizing Enhanced Practice through Adaptive Tutoring), a tool to build virtual guided practice environments for developing skills in clinical communication domains. Use of SNAP and REPEAT will provide an advanced starting point that allows us to focus on the specific training and community application needs of the DDBHH community, rather than new technology development. Our ability to address these specific needs and to appropriately deliver and evaluate the interventions is supported by a highly interdisciplinary team, spanning expertise in DDBHH health disparity, disability studies, public health, health informatics, cultural anthropology, human factors engineering, and computer science",U01,OD,OD,DE;OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10414441,U01OD033240,U01OD033240-01,33240,,,2021,1,2616,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
3540,Impact of Privacy Environments for Personal Health Data on Patients,"A big data ecosystem is evolving in our society in which people may have, or feel they have, little control over the flow of their personal health information, and thus their privacy. Further, although there has been significant discussion related to big data and privacy at the highest levels of government, there is little consensus among scholars and stakeholders as to what privacy actually is, not to mention a lack of data from individuals as to personal conceptions of privacy. While much has been written about the potential harms of this and the rapidity with which the divide between health-related big data capabilities and privacy controls and protections is widening, we have little systematic knowledge of the nature and impacts of individual-level privacy concerns, and no reliable and valid tools for acquiring such knowledge from patients. The goal of this project is to conceptualize, measure, and understand individual privacy affinities and responses to privacy environments in the context of health-related big data technologies. The primary deliverable of the project will be a psychometrically sound instrument: the Privacy Affinities and Privacy Environment Responses (""PAPER"") scale. Privacy has been the subject of several proposed theoretical frameworks in many different fields including philosophy, sociology, and law. Considering privacy from a behavioral and psychological perspective, we propose a preliminary conceptual model in which privacy is a combination of stable individual privacy affinities or predilections and changing individual responses to different privacy environments. We propose a three-phase project using qualitative and quantitative methods: In Phase One, we will refine our conceptual model through comprehensive literature review, individual interviews, focus groups, consultation with experts, and analyses of preliminary data from two previous studies. In Phase Two, we will develop a psychometrically sound instrument to measure individual privacy affinities and privacy environment responses related to personal health data information technologies according to established practices for measuring patient-reported outcomes. We will leverage an established instrument development platform. In Phase Three, we will administer this instrument to an online patient community of over 2,000 individuals. We will explore the relationship between privacy and propensity to adopt health-related big data technologies, willingness to share personal health data for research, and disease type and stage. To accomplish these goals, we have assembled a team of experts in bioethics, law, information and computer science, clinical psychology, medicine and public health, psychometrics and instrument development, privacy theory and technology, online survey research, and health policy. Development of an instrument to assess privacy will catalyze patient- and community-engaged research on this important topic. In turn, this will inform and promote development of transparent, patient- and user-centered privacy policies and practices, which are critically needed at this time of unprecedented technological advancement.",R01,HG,NHGRI,HG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9007754,R01HG008753,R01HG008753-01,8753,,,2015,1,2618,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3552,Non-Invasive Neuromodulation Device for the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder,"Excessive alcohol consumption is the third leading cause of death in the United States, and approximately 15 million Americans suffer from alcohol use disorder (AUD). AUD also economically expensive, with $249 billion spent annually for costs related to healthcare, lost work productivity, and crime. Despite the high prevalence of AUD and its severe consequences, less than 20% of those with AUD receive any treatment, mainly due to key drawbacks of current treatment options. Guidelines for AUD treatment include pharmacotherapy, behavioral intervention, or both. Meta-analyses consistently demonstrate that first-line AUD medications (naltrexone and acamprosate) are only moderately effective, at best. AUD pharmacotherapies also have common side effects that limit acceptability to patients. Similar to medications, behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), provide only small/moderate treatment benefits. In addition, programs often require abstinence, which can be a barrier as many AUD patients prefer non-abstinent goals. Recent preclinical and clinical research has shown that acupuncture of a peripheral nerve pathway can significantly modulate craving-, reward-, and withdrawal-related responses for drugs of abuse. We, thus, hypothesize that peripheral nerve stimulation can be an effective treatment for AUD through its direct effects on craving, reward, and withdrawal. Thus, TheraNova has developed the Empower Neuromodulation System, a portable, easy-to-use transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device for non-invasive nerve stimulation as a treatment for AUD. The Empower Neuromodulation System consists of a small, wearable Controller and gel electrodes that are temporarily adhered to the skin to stimulate the underlying nerve. Our Phase I clinical study with AUD patients demonstrated that the Empower treatment significantly reduced alcohol consumption (mean reduction = 29%, p=0.026), alcohol craving intensity (mean reduction 21%, p=0.001), and anxiety (mean reduction = 31%, p<0.001) (vs. baseline week measurements) after only two weeks of treatment. While promising, this was a two-week, open-label study, so a longer, sham-controlled pivotal trial is needed to rigorously verify that Empower offers a comprehensive AUD treatment. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will first update the design of the Empower Neuromodulation System and conduct all bench testing required to support an FDA submission. Then, in Aim 2, we will conduct a multi- site, sham-controlled pivotal clinical trial to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of Empower as a treatment for AUD. The data obtained through this work will support FDA clearance, enabling commercialization of the Empower Neuromodulation System as a comprehensive treatment for AUD.",R44,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,10267074,R44AA027188,R44AA027188-02,27188,,,2021,2,2630,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3559,Wearable Microfluidic Systems for Measuring Sweat Biomarkers in Cystic Fibrosis Patients During Exercise in Remote Settings,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene which lead to impaired chloride (Cl-) movement across the plasma membrane. Individuals with CF typically excrete sweat with substantially higher Cl- and sodium (Na+) concentrations than healthy individuals. CF can lead to multi-organ manifestations, either primarily or secondarily (i.e. bronchiectasis, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, malnutrition, depression). Exercise is recommended as adjunctive treatment for many of these manifestations and exercise capacity has been shown to be an independent factor in CF survival. With the recent approval of highly effective CFTR modulators (HEMT) for 90% of CF patients, it is likely that survival for CF patients will increase substantially and it is anticipated that many patients will survive into their sixties. The efficacy of HEMT has led to some unintended consequences such as that some patients have become obese (BMI>30) and many have become less adherent to their daily airway clearance regimen and rely on exercise for airway clearance. These factors underscore the importance that regular vigorous exercise will play in ongoing care of CF patients, which is now expected to last many more decades. Since excessive water and electrolyte losses can contribute to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, CF patients are at high risk for severe dehydration and electrolyte loss which can have deleterious consequences and limit intensity of exercise. There is substantial data that has described sweat rates and electrolyte loss in response to exercise in normal athletes, however, there is limited data for CF patients. We recently reported a novel skin-interfaced wearable microfluidic device and smartphone image processing platform that enables analysis of regional sweating rate and sweat chloride loss in athletes and CF pediatric patients in a mode that is comfortable and imperceptible to the wearer. We hypothesize that continuous electrolyte and sweat rate measurements captured with our soft wearable microfluidic sensors and smartphone application (called the CF Patch System) will provide actionable hydration and electrolyte repletion information for adult CF patients during exercise. The CF Patch wearable platform offers a groundbreaking approach for the quantitative and continuous assessment of CF hydration and health conditions. The foundational insights from this work will enable new care management paradigms for CF patients in remote settings.",R43,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10383275,R43HL162246,R43HL162246-01,162246,,,2022,1,2637,Pablo,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
3595,Breastfeeding Support and Weight Management for Black Women: A Dual Intervention,"Excessive pregnancy-related weight retention is an important determinant of obesity and is more common among African American women. At the same time, breastfeeding, which has been recommended as a strategy to decrease weight retention is lowest among African American women. This racial disparity in breastfeeding may partly explain the disparity in obesity, but even if the two are not causally related, a dual intervention designed to increase breastfeeding duration and decrease postpartum weight retention makes practical sense because both are associated with the same critical postpartum time window. For this study, we will incorporate a postpartum weight management component into an effective breastfeeding support program. This dual intervention will use a combination of in- person, telephone, and interactive web/mobile-based health counseling to provide education and support for breastfeeding difficulties and postpartum weight management. The intervention will be delivered by peer counselors who will be trained to provide support using motivational interviewing techniques with consultation by experts. Additionally, the web-based platform includes tools for tracking diet and physical activity, and is accessible using mobile technology. We have designed the dual intervention to provide encouragement, information, and problem- solving assistance at the appropriate pre or postpartum stage for both breastfeeding support and maternal weight management. The mixed delivery mode has proven effective in other settings and is important to build a trusting relationship while allowing frequent and flexible methods for communicating during this vulnerable time in a new mom's life. The overall goal of this developmental/exploratory R21 proposal is to gather pilot data to effectively refine the intervention so that it can be tested in a larger, longer study using a factorial design in a futur R01 phase. We will recruit, in one large inner-city prenatal care clinic (Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI), pregnant African American women (32-36 weeks gestation) who are considering breastfeeding (n=80), randomize them to the intervention or to a usual care group, and follow all participants to 20 weeks postpartum. Our specific aims are to: 1) test feasibility; 2) assess acceptability; and 3) estimate the effect size of the intervention at 20 weeks postpartum relative to the usual care group on (1) breastfeeding duration and (2) postpartum weight retention. This project is significant because the combined intervention is designed to work synergistically on two interrelated, highly prevalent problems that disproportionately disadvantage African American families.",R21,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9110604,R21HD085138,R21HD085138-01A1,85138,A1,,2016,1,2675,Audie,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3598,Multi-center trial of Augmented Sensory Feedback in Children with Dyskinetic CP,"The immediate effects of brain injury in both children and adults are directly related to loss of function in injured regions. In children the effects of early brain injury are further magnified due to distortion of subsequent development, motor learning and skill acquisition. These complications provide a unique opportunity for treatment if changes due to plasticity and distorted learning can be reversed. We have previously shown that children with dystonia due to dyskinetic cerebral palsy (CP) have deficits of sensory processing. Our goal is to show that this deficit specifically interferes with motor learning. The opportunity for improved treatment arises from the potential for improved motor learning if we can increase sensory function or awareness through the use of augmented sensory feedback. We combine a newly-developed figure-8 drawing task from the laboratory of Alessandra Pedrocchi in Milan, with a new speed-accuracy learning paradigm from the laboratory of Pietro Mazzoni in New York to show that deficits of sensory and motor behavior interfere with motor learning. We also test a newly-developed self- feeding task where speed depends upon the ability to carry an object in a spoon. We will determine if model- based interventions can improve real-world function and motor skill many years after injury, using a wearable device that enhances sensory information about muscle activity. We propose the following experiments: 1. Perform a multi-center clinical trial to test the effect of one month of wearable sensory feedback on real-world skill learning in children with dyskinetic CP and primary dystonia. We hypothesize that such intervention will permit acquisition of skills in the child's natural environment that wee not previously achievable through unaided practice, but that these effects will be greatest in children with dyskinetic CP for whom sensory deficits are often present from birth. 2. Test the effect of enhanced sensory feedback during drawing movements and a self-feeding task in children with dyskinetic CP, primary dystonia, and controls. We compare 5 days of learning with augmented feedback to 5 days of learning without feedback. These experiments create a theoretical and experimental foundation for a new understanding of how early brain injury interacts with motor development and skill acquisition in childhood. They perform a multi- center clinical trial of a new noninvasive intervention with significant potential for improving function n this population. They provide a detailed quantification in the laboratory of daily changes due to learning, and the sensory-motor mechanisms responsible for these changes. This understanding will lead to new treatment approaches based on correcting deficits that prevent or distort motor learning. These experiments will provide a significant change in the paradigm for understanding childhood motor deficits, by shifting focus from the immediate effect of injury to the long-term effects on development, motor learning, and skill acquisition.",R01,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8886893,R01HD081346,R01HD081346-01A1,81346,A1,,2015,1,2679,Audie,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
3602,Peer i-Coaching for Activated Self-management Optimization in Adolescents and Young Adults with Chronic Conditions,"Increases in life expectancy in almost all childhood-onset chronic conditions has brought unique challenges for adolescents and young adults (AYA) who struggle to deal with the associated disease burden, manage therapies, and thrive as they develop independent self-management skills, and become active and engaged patients. The challenges that influence the lives of AYAs are largely adaptive, such as making lifestyle modifications, adhering to complex medication regimens, and learning to navigate the adult health system. Adding to this complexity is the need for AYAs to progressively take over greater self-management responsibilities from parents. Promoting activated self-management is critically important given that this shift in health care management from parents and health care providers to the AYA is identified as key to successful adult outcomes. Peer support interventions are well-suited to address challenges theorized as critical to AYAs given the importance of peer relationships during this time. We propose a mixed-methods, five-year randomized controlled trial, that will include 225 AYAs (16-22 years) with COCCs, to test the Peer i-Coaching for Activated Self- Management Optimization (PICASO) versus an attention control group. This novel, mobile health intervention utilizes an established telephone/text based secure interface to allow AYAs access knowledge, experience, and instrumental/emotional support from a trained peer coach (18-26 years), who has already developed independence and is an active self-manager. We will determine the efficacy of the PICASO on self-management/health care navigation, patient activation, coping, emotional health and health-related quality of life across 12 months. We will explore whether age, sex, race/ethnicity, chronic condition, and/or disease severity moderate the trajectory of PICASO effects on self-management, patient activation, coping, emotional health and health-related quality of life. Lastly, we will explore mechanisms of the PICASO impact by describing AYA experiences with the intervention.",R01,NR,NINR,NR;OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9687430,R01NR018379,R01NR018379-01,18379,,,2019,1,2683,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
3605,"Translating an In-Person Brief, Bystander Bullying Intervention (STAC) to a Technology-Based Intervention","While studies support the efficacy of comprehensive, school-wide interventions in reducing bullying, these types of programs can require significant time and financial resources for implementation, resulting in barriers to providing school-based bullying prevention, especially in low-income and rural communities. Additionally, although training bystanders to act as ""defenders"" on behalf of targets of bullying is an important intervention component, few programs include this as part of their comprehensive strategy. Brief programs that focus on bystander training and require fewer resources are needed to reduce bullying and its negative consequences. The PI (Dr. Midgett) developed STAC, a brief, stand-alone bullying bystander intervention for middle school students, to reduce bullying and mental health risks for bystanders. Brief, in-person programs, however, still pose implementation barrier such as training school personnel, providing external support, and not allowing for large groups of students to be trained at the same time. For this project, we propose to develop a technology- based STAC intervention (STAC-T) that will allow students to customize their experience by selecting avatars and bullying scenarios based on our previous studies conducted in a range of middle schools, including those in low-income and rural communities. We will also incorporate an assessment and personalized feedback component to promote behavior change. The innovative, user-centered design proposed will be inherently sensitive to cultural needs of students and identify personally-appropriate strategies. The specific aims of this application include conducting a needs analysis to determine product need, building a system prototype leveraging our prior work and expertise of an external advisory board, and usability and effectiveness testing with middle school students and stakeholders to evaluate feasibility. This proposal is designed to document proof of concept and finalizing design and content of the system which will be developed and tested in a subsequent randomized clinical trial. The technology-based platform will increase the overall reach, impact, and sustainability of the STAC intervention for bullying prevention. It will substantially reduce cost to increase reach and its interactivity and algorithms can tailor program content to adapt it further for students attending low-income and rural schools. Thus, this low-cost, easy to disseminate technology-based bullying bystander intervention has the potential to have a substantial impact on the problem of bullying and the negative associated consequences for both students who are targets and bystanders in middle school when the problem of bullying peaks. There is a large market for the STAC-T intervention with approximately 100,000 public and private schools with middle-school grades in the United States. Globally, the online education market is growing at 10% a year and the digital health market exceeds $220 billion annually.",R41,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9909166,R41MD014943,R41MD014943-01,14943,,,2019,1,2687,Josh,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
3609,Electrical Impedance-Based Wearable Device for Monitoring Inflammation in Knee Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis is the most common chronic illness and the leading cause of pain and disability among older adults, affecting more than 12% of the total US population and as many as 90% of persons over 65. As the population ages, prevalence of OA is rising sharply; it is projected that by 2030, 1 in 40 Americans will have arthritis, the majority of cases being OA. For those already living with OA, the capacity to monitor symptoms and identify exacerbating factors would significantly improve quality of life. However, current techniques for characterizing and monitoring OA-related inflammation fail to deliver a cost effective and simple solution that can be widely used by patients for continuous self-monitoring. In this study we propose developing a wearable to collect quantitative information on inflammation which have the potential to monitor disease progression without costly and invasive technologies. Such devices have strong potential to provide OA patients and providers with insight into the origins of pain and other symptoms and factors that may influence progression of the disease. First we will engage consumer input from practitioners and OA patients to identify their human fac- tors necessary for adoption of the wearable device. Second, we will devise and test a device that collects lo- calized electrical impedance measures of the knee, previously shown able to differentiate between groups with and without OA, in laboratory conditions to validate its operation.

3618,TeleHealth Resistance exercise Intervention to preserve dose intensity and Vitality in Elder breast cancer patients (THRIVE),"More than 276,480 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020, with 120,000 cases occurring in women 65 years or older. Given the increasing median age of the US population, the number of breast cancers diagnosed in older women is expected to rise by 50% in the coming decades. Older women with breast cancer experience worse breast cancer-specific outcomes as compared to younger women, under-treatment is likely to play a central role. Studies have demonstrated that breast cancer patients who receive <85% of received dose intensity (RDI), a metric that combines the total dose administered with adherence to the planned treatment schedule, have a 57% increase in the risk of disease recurrence at 10 years as compared to women who receive at least 85% RDI. Only 50-76% of breast cancer patients >65 receive an RDI >85, largely due to increased toxicity of therapy in these patients. Reducing treatment-related toxicity to enhance RDI is critical to improving disease outcomes among the growing population of older breast cancer patients. To this end, models predicting for severe chemotoxicity demonstrate that a number of potentially modifiable factors (commonly assessed as part of the geriatric assessment), are important determinants of chemotoxicity, including function, depression, and falls (or use of assistive devices). Exercise has a significant positive impact on each of these modifiable factors, in the general population and in cancer patients. However, data on the ability of exercise interventions to improve treatment tolerance and preserve dose intensity among older breast cancer patients are lacking. We propose a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a multicomponent, hybrid telehealth (TH) exercise and protein intake support (the THRIVE Intervention) on RDI, incidence and severity of chemotoxicities, functional status, muscle mass, and patient reported outcomes in 270 breast cancer patients age ≥ 65 receiving neo/adjuvant chemotherapy. Participants will be randomized to the THRIVE Intervention or to a Health Education and Support control group. The intervention will be delivered through a hybrid model, leveraging the existing Breast Cancer Weight Loss (BWEL) Trial call center. After 2 in-person, onsite exercise sessions, we will transition to TH sessions delivered on study provided tablets, by certified exercise coaches who will tailor behavior change to support adherence relative to symptom burden. To optimize intervention effectiveness, participants will undergo a TH evaluation of diet adequacy with a registered dietitian, focused on optimal daily protein intake. Protein supplementation will be provided if needed to achieve 1.2 gm/kg daily intake. The TH focus consolidates expertise at a well-established call center (BWEL), elevating the potential for broad implementation across the U.S., including cancer treatment centers with too few patients to justify necessary personnel. The project also seeks to evaluate intervention cost, as well as the facilitators and barriers to implementation of this TH intervention, toward the goal of translation to clinical practice upon successful completion of the THRIVE trial.",U01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10450916,U01CA271277,U01CA271277-01,271277,,,2022,1,2700,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
3626,Mobile Diagnosis of Congenital Genetic Conditions: A Model for Screening and Surveillance in Low-Resource Settings,"Congenital anomalies represent an increasing burden of disease worldwide, accounting for millions of birth defect-related disabilities with a disproportionate impact on Low to Middle Income Countries (LIMCs). Many harbor genetic etiologies, for which no confirmatory diagnosis can be made due to the dearth of diagnostic technologies in most LMICs. The inability to rapidly and accurately diagnose individuals that harbor a genetic syndrome increases the risk of mortality and morbidity (as a number of manageable congenital anomalies may be hidden, such as congenital heart defects or hearing infections) and prevents the accurate determination of prevalence rates, critical for public health surveillance and intervention programs. The first part (R21) of this project addresses these gaps using two synergistic mobile health intervention tools to screen for syndromic conditions and specifically demonstrate that a specific diagnostic of Down syndrome (expandable to all aneuploidies and those diseases resulting from copy number variants, point mutations and insertions/deletions) can be performed with minimal resources, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Aim 1 will be to train and validate AI-guided smartphone-based technology to screen for syndromic conditions, while Aim 2 will create low-cost, rapid initial genetic diagnostic capacity in the DRC. In the expansion part of the proposal (R33), we will test whether the implementation of a registry measuring health outcomes can be used as a scalable model for future newborn screening and health surveillance in a low-resource setting. To this effect, Aim 3 will build infrastructure for birth defects detection, genetic confirmation, competence building, and practice and outcomes surveillance in low-resource conditions with two parallel sub-aims: Aim 3a will assess the feasibility of the diagnostic capacity on a large population sample and provide a tool to measure specific health outcomes, while Aim 3b will establish a small-scale and functional database/registry of morphological, genetic, and health outcomes data. In limited resources settings, comprehensive systems to detect, refer, treat and surveil individuals with congenital anomalies are non-existent. Our innovative technologies will address this gap, build local capacity of diagnostic screening and of a data registry, allowing for early diagnosis and condition-specific care, likely to lower morbidity and mortality of children with non-communicable syndromic conditions.",R21,HD,NICHD,TW;OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10267068,R21HD102988,R21HD102988-01A1,102988,A1,,2021,1,2708,Audie,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3643,An automated portable system for detecting and treating opioid induced respiratory depression,"Opioid overdoses caused almost 70,000 deaths in the US in the year ending in November 2020. Many of these occur during the therapeutic use of prescription opioids, particularly when consumption is erratic or among workers from certain professions. Despite the promotion of naloxone for opioid overdose, the effective rescue of an individual from an overdose during the therapeutic use of opioids is still very challenging for several reasons: (1) the onset of an opioid overdose may be very difficult for the patient or their associates to rapidly recognize; (2) the time between the onset of respiratory depression and irreversible brain damage or death is brief; leaving a brief time window to seek medical help and intervene; and (3) methods employed by self- or bystanders to treat an opioid overdose may not be available or are complicated for lay individuals to use. Thus, there is an urgent and unmet need for real-time detection and automated treatment of opioid overdose, even during the therapeutic use of opioids. The overall objective of this U01 application is to develop an automated portable system to detect and treat an opioid overdose in real time. The research team pursues engineering advances in developing wearable sensors for real-time tracking of multiple physiological parameters and therapeutic patches for precise transdermal delivery of naloxone, respectively. The proposed project will further develop wearable sensors to track the variation of physiological parameters (e.g., breathing pattern, blood oxygen level, and heart rate) for the real-time detection of an opioid overdose. The proposed project also aims to optimize novel acoustic patches to deliver naloxone for treating an opioid overdose. A closed-loop system will be established through integration of a wearable sensor, a therapeutic patch, a machine learning-based controller driven by a cell phone. The proposed system will be validated using a mouse model of opioid overdose well developed in the PI's lab, and adapted for the potential translational applications in human patients.

3679,Wearable multifunctional optical device for early detection of postpartum hemorrhage,"In this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence application, Dr. Christine O'Brien proposes detailed training in optoelectronics and postpartum hemorrhage physiology that will strategically complement her expertise in the development of optical diagnostics for women's health. The training plan is paired with scientific studies that will develop and utilize a novel multifunctional optical device for early detection of postpartum hemorrhage in pregnant patients. The primary goal of Dr. O'Brien is to become an independent researcher in women's health technologies. The rigorous training described and the outstanding team of mentors in wearable optical devices (Drs. Achilefu and Culver) and translational maternal health research (Drs. England and Stout) will ensure her success in reaching this ambitious goal. Through her training plan, Dr. O'Brien will gain 1) expertise in development of small, portable optoelectronic devices; 2) strengthened knowledge of postpartum hemorrhage physiology and research; and 3) knowledge of strategies and best practices for running a successful and innovative independent lab. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), defined as the loss of 1 L of blood or more within 24 hours after birth, is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Importantly, PPH is the most preventable cause of maternal mortality, and the leading factors causing preventable PPH are delay in diagnosis and treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need for an early and accurate alert system that can facilitate prompt treatment to prevent PPH-related mo. During hemorrhage, the body tries to compensate for blood loss by shunting blood from the periphery to vital organs and replenishing reduced blood volume with water from the interstitium. These compensation mechanisms help stabilize the patient, delaying the time until global vascular indicators such as blood pressure and heart rate are affected, the current measurements used to predict PPH. Thus, monitoring of peripheral blood flow and blood content can yield early indicators of hemorrhage. Optical technologies are well suited to noninvasively measure blood flow and blood content. Preliminary experiments run by the candidate demonstrated sensitivity to reduced perfusion in vivo and measured significant differences between blood samples diluted to physiologic levels seen during PPH using complimentary optical approaches. Based on this preliminary data, she hypothesizes that early changes in peripheral blood flow and water transfer from interstitium to the vasculature will be detected using wearable optical techniques, and such changes can detect early stages of PPH.

3692,Integrating pain-CBT into an mHealth analgesic support intervention for patients with chronic pain from advanced cancers,"Pain affects approximately two thirds of patients with advanced incurable cancers. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for pain (pain-CBT) is an effective treatment for chronic pain from cancer. Unfortunately, pain-CBT in its traditional format (60-minute, in-person sessions) is often unrealistic for patients with advanced cancer. Behavioral treatments require substantial adaptation to meet advanced cancer patients' real-life needs, and should ideally integrate with their pharmacotherapy (e.g. opioid) plans. Mobile health (mHealth) technology is a promising strategy to deliver and ultimately disseminate brief pain-CBT interventions to cancer patients. The goal of Dr. Azizoddin's K08 proposal is to develop a novel mHealth application that integrates brief pain- CBT into an existing mHealth application designed to optimize opioid management for patients with chronic pain from advanced incurable cancers. Leveraging co-mentor's app (R21-funded), Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP) is a patient-facing smartphone app that facilitates daily symptom and opioid monitoring and delivers tailored pain education and advice. Following the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development (Stage:1A&1B), Dr. Azizoddin will create STAMP+CBT, a novel intervention that harmonizes psychological and medical support for advanced cancer pain. In AIM 1: the PI will develop and refine STAMP+CBT by adapting pain-CBT for brief mHealth delivery through a series of iterative qualitative interviews, and wireframe and user acceptability testing (AIM 1A). STAMP+CBT will be programmed and tested in a small pre-pilot with the target population to inform app refinements (AIM 1B). In AIM 2: 60 patients with chronic pain related to advanced cancer will be randomized to the app or usual care + digital cancer pain education for 6 weeks. Feasibility of the study will be determined by examining recruitment/retention rates and completion rates of app-delivered pain-CBT content. A subset of patients will complete qualitative debriefing interviews to inform final app refinements. Measures will explore anticipated primary (pain interference) and secondary pain outcomes to inform the design of a future (R01) efficacy trial of STAMP+CBT. Dr. Azizoddin's research activities will be mentored by an interdisciplinary team of expert investigators in pain psychology (Robert Edwards, PhD), palliative care clinical trials (Andrea Enzinger, MD & James Tulsky, MD), cancer pain (Christine Miaskowski, PhD), and mobile health (Michael Businelle, PhD & Daniel Gundersen, PhD). This K08 proposal will allow Dr. Azizoddin to acquire training in: 1) adapting psychological pain interventions for cancer populations, 2) learning rigorous methods to develop/refine behavioral mHealth interventions, 3) conducting randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions, and 4) conducting longitudinal analysis of momentary pain/psychological mHealth data. This training program and structured mentorship under the guidance of esteemed research faculty will provide Dr. Azizoddin with the support necessary to become a successful, independent investigator, specializing in effective and scalable behavioral treatments to improve cancer pain.",K08,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10349763,K08CA266937,K08CA266937-01,266937,,,2022,1,2775,Josh,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
3706,Mobile Application to Deliver Personalized Nutrition for the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease,"Genben Lifesciences (dba GB HealthWatch) is a digital health and nutritional genomics company. Our mission is to help fight common, diet- and lifestyle-related chronic diseases with precision nutrition and advanced mobile technologies. Our company developed the HealthWatch 360 mobile app for tracking dietary intake, physical activity and health-related symptoms. This mobile app has received excellent reviews for both the iOS and Android platforms and has over 70,000 registered users. Health condition- specific goals featured in the app provide refined nutritional recommendations based on clinical guidelines for the prevention of diet-induced, chronic diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the U.S., the 6th leading cause of mortality and a major cost to the nation, families and caregivers. This phase I proposal is for the development of a mobile tool that will deliver personalized nutrition and meal plans based on genetic risk in order to mitigate AD risk. Aim 1: Develop a systematic process to identify specific dietary and nutritional components associated with AD. Using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 database and nutritional analyses of the traditional diets that correspond with the 26 populations, we will analyze whether specific nutrients correlate with the frequency of genetic variants that predispose risk of AD. We hypothesize that a population's fitness would be enhanced and AD risk would be lower when the genetic variants that are selected for in a given population are in equilibrium with a diet that is enriched or depleted with the correlated nutrient(s). We will develop statistical models that will quantify these relationships. Aim 2: Translate nutritional patterns to a set of quantitative recommendations for AD prevention. With the nutrient data we obtain from Aim 1, combined with other evidence-based nutrition guidelines for AD, we will synthesize a set of qualitative and quantitative nutritional ""rules"" based on the app user's genotypes, family history of AD and other health conditions. These genotype- and/or phenotype - specific rules will estimate ideal ranges for a given nutrient and amend the conventional ""rules"" (i.e. nutritional recommendations) by the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for America. Aim 3: Mobile app for delivery of personalized meal plan for the prevention of AD. This mobile application is designed for guided, proactive and self-executed prevention of AD, and targeted at those who are at elevated risk. We propose developing machine-learning algorithms to create meal plans that employ the modified nutrient ranges (from Aims 1 and 2) for a given AD risk genotype. Users will be able to modify food preference parameters (for example, ""vegetarian"") while maintaining the appropriate nutrient ranges. A key outcome of this project will be a platform that supports population-wide dietary intervention by seamlessly connecting preventive healthcare with daily life in the digital age.",R43,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9254310,R43AG055203,R43AG055203-01,55203,,,2016,1,2789,Chris,,,,,,,,,
3716,JHU-IKU Mobile Health for Child Injury Prevention in Malaysia (M-CHILD),"Malaysia, like other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), faces an increasing burden of childhood injuries occurring in the home or its immediate environment. At the same time, widespread and growing ownership and use of mobile phones has created a promising avenue for delivery of health interventions at low cost. We aim to harness the immense potential of mobile technologies to lessen the burden of child injuries. The overall goal of the JHU-IKU M-CHILD program is to strengthen mobile health capacity to assess risks and improve prevention of child injuries at home in Malaysia through an innovative model of sustainable capacity development. Our specific aims are (1) to develop an mHealth tool for home risk assessment and prevention of child injuries, a key national priority in Malaysia, focusing on feasible, measureable in-home interventions. This tool will be used to map risks for injury to children <5 years, which will stimulate hazard reduction interventions through an innovative data-driven mhealth application (the MAP- CHILD app); (2) to pilot-test MAP-CHILD in Malaysia to evaluate data quality and user operability by families; and (3) to develop a core group of researchers focused on the use and integration of mHealth for research and training in public health at Institute for Public Health (IKU) in Malaysia through a short-term, structured, mHealth capacity-building training program for researchers from IKU that will include an innovative e-mentoring program; in-country training workshops at IKU; and online courses and webinars from JHU on priority topics in m-capacity. The JHU-IKU M-CHILD project is a novel application of mHealth in the area of injury prevention, grounded in scientific principles that hav been found effective through other modes of delivery, such as home visits. We will develop a simple, ""fun,"" yet creative and rigorous mobile phone app that will prevent in-home risks for child injuries, thereby reducing the burden of injuries among children in Malaysia. The innovation's benefits will not be limited to children or to Malaysia; once developed, the app will be easily adaptable to other LMIC settings. The JHU-IKU M-CHILD program will also transform the mHealth environment at IKU and in Malaysia. Through a transformative approach, we will implement a capacity development model using m-capacity to conduct research around a nationally relevant issue while our two institutions collaborate to develop a locally relevant data registry and injury outcome tool (Aim 1). The registry will be implemented in one district to assess its feasibility and develop the capacity of the centers to evaluate and follow outcomes in risk reduction (Aim 2). We will use the interest at IKU in teaching and research on child injuries specifically, and public health in general, and at JHU in global and mobile health, to strengthen m-capacity expertise in one of the premier institutions in Malaysia (Aim 3). We envision that this program will lead to the future development of a program dedicated to the use of mHealth in global health research and training at IKU and Malaysia.",R21,TW,FIC,TW,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8928657,R21TW009930,R21TW009930-02,9930,,,2015,2,2800,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3723,5/5 HEAL Consortium: Establishing Innovative Approaches for the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study,"Opioid use among pregnant women is increasing significantly, and consequently, a more than 5-fold increase in the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has been reported since 2000. Preliminary studies show that prenatal opioid exposure is associated with increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment across cognitive, motor and behavioral domains. Therefore, studies to rigorously characterize the impacts of prenatal opioid exposure on early brain development are critically needed. In our application, five institutions (Duke University, Arkansas Children's Research Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) with complementary expertise, have formed a consortium to develop strategies to prepare for the Phase II HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study, a planned large scale multi-site research study to examine the long-term impact of prenatal drug exposure on long term childhood outcomes. Leveraging the unique skills of our multidisciplinary team, we will develop essential instruments and strategies (recruitment/retention protocols, assessment batteries, and novel tools) for the Phase II study (Aim 1). We will conduct pilot studies (fetal and postnatal imaging, advanced imaging harmonization and quality control, assessment administration, biosampling) to evaluate instruments for the Phase II study (Aim 2). Finally, we will analyze available data (Aim 3), including imaging, behavioral, cognitive and maternal data from studies focusing on early brain development, to provide critical information to guide the Phase II study design. Upon completion of the proposed aims, our consortium will be in an ideal position to conduct the future Phase II study.",R34,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,9900516,R34DA050256,R34DA050256-01,50256,,,2019,1,2807,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3733,Insertable Cardiac Monitor-Guided Early Intervention to Reduce Atrial Fibrillation Burden Following Catheter Ablation (ICM-REDUCE-AF Trial),"Insertable Cardiac Monitor-Guided Early Intervention to Reduce Atrial Fibrillation Burden Following Catheter Ablation (ICM-REDUCE-AF Trial) PI: Ilan Goldenberg, MD, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY Percutaneous catheter ablation (CA) to achieve pulmonary vein electrical isolation is an effective and recommended treatment for drug-refractory paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Nevertheless, recurrence rates after a single AF ablation procedure are in the range of 30%-50%. Accordingly, more measures are needed to improve success rates following CA of AF. To date, conventional management after CA ablation has mostly been based on intervention for clinical AF recurrence. Continuous recording with insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) can now be used to detect early recurrences of subclinical AF (SCAF) and patients-triggered mobile app transmissions post ablation. We hypothesize that early intervention following CA can prevent substrate progression that promotes the onset and maintenance of atrial arrhythmias. We therefore propose a randomized, double-blind (to SCAF data), single center, clinical trial in which 120 patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF or persistent AF planned to undergo CA with an ICM, will be randomized to: an intervention arm (n=60) consisting of ICM-guided early intervention based on SCAF and patient-triggered mobile app transmissions vs. a control arm (n=60) consisting of a standard intervention protocol based on clinical AF recurrence validated by the ICM. We believe that ICM-guided early intervention management provides a novel personalized approach and a paradigm shift in post-AF ablation management that will result in a significant reduction in AF burden and healthcare utilization in this expanding population, with corresponding improvements in functional capacity and quality of life, compared with conventional follow-up after AF ablation. In the proposed clinical trial, Aim 1 is to evaluate whether ICM-guided early intervention based on SCAF detection and symptom-triggered mobile app transmissions will be associated with a significant reduction in AF burden following CA for AF compared with the standard strategy of treatment upon the development of clinical AF recurrence. AF burden will be assessed from ICMs at 15 months post-AF ablation (excluding the 3-month blanking period). Aim 2 is to evaluate whether ICM-guided early intervention management will be associated with a reduction in in healthcare utilization (defined as unplanned hospitalizations, emergency department visits, cardioversions, and unplanned office visits) compared with a conventional management strategy. Aim 3 is to evaluate whether ICM-guided early intervention management will be associated with improvement in functional capacity and quality of life compared with a conventional management strategy following CA for AF.",R61,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10202853,R61HL153001,R61HL153001-01A1,153001,A1,,2021,1,2817,Tom,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3758,Expressive Speech Synthesis for Speech-Generating Devices,"The ability to express emotion through speech is an essential element of human communication, yet individuals with speech impairments who rely on speech-generating devices to communicate are often deprived of this ability. Current speech-generating devices offer at most a limited number of expressive speech modes (e.g., a ""happy"" voice or a ""sad"" voice), and even when those are provided, they are often not perceived by listeners in the intended way. The proposed project aims to remedy this unfortunate situation by enhancing the rule-based Synfonica text-to-speech system with the ability to accurately convey a broad range of emotional states. The approach to be tested centers on a set of expressive speech meta-parameters that collectively describe the ""higher-level"" characteristics of the speech output required for conveying the intended emotion for a given utterance. Examples of such meta-parameters include speaking rate, pitch range, and degree of breathiness. The text-to-speech rules will implement the complex mapping from meta-parameter values to the relevant ""lower-level"" acoustic parameter values used by a synthesizer to produce the final speech waveform. Examples of such acoustic parameters are the fundamental frequency of voicing, formant frequencies, and voicing amplitude. The Phase I project aims to test the feasibility of this approach by enhancing the Synfonica system to convey four emotions-elation, sadness, and two flavors of anger (""hot"" anger and ""cold"" anger)-on a restricted set of utterance types. A set of perceptual tests will be conducted to determine the extent to which listeners recognize the intended emotions in the synthesized speech. If successful, the Phase I project will lay the groundwork for providing users of speech-generating devices with the means to effectively convey their emotional states through speech. It also will further scientific knowledge regarding the perceptual cues used by listeners in gauging a speaker's emotional state.",R43,DC,NIDCD,DC,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8903390,R43DC014173,R43DC014173-01A1,14173,A1,,2015,1,2844,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,

3765,Wearable Noninvasive Blood Alcohol Monitor,"The overall goal of the Phase I program will be to provide proof of feasibility for a new, unobtrusive wrist band style blood alcohol sensor. The device will continuously measure blood alcohol content (BAC) by noninvasive detection of transdermal alcohol content (TAC) using an ultralow power (microwatt), tiny, printed gas sensor recently developed in our company. The wrist band will also provide several key physiological measurements (temperature, local skin humidity, position/activity and heart rate detection) in addition to BAC. This device will prove beneficial in clinical and research settings, alcohol treatment programs, the criminal justice system and public safety. Capitalizing on the recent trend toward public demand for wearable technology for health monitoring, the wristband will also be attractive to individuals who wish to use it for health and activity tracking. The vast majority of alcohol monitoring performed today is done in support of court-ordered alcohol treatment, for example in DUI cases. The ankle monitors used here are bulky, obtrusive and can interfere with the performance of daily routine activities. The goal of this program is to develop new wrist band style monitor that is smaller, nonintrusive, comfortable and more appealing to the wearer. This will facilitate treatment compliance and will make the product more appealing to the mass market, for example, in voluntary health and fitness sectors. The technical strategy for Phase I will focus on the fabrication and validation of the ultralow power printed alcohol sensor for measurement of transdermal alcohol and incorporation of the sensor and supporting electronics into a wristband sized package. Selected supporting physiological sensors will be identified and tested along with the alcohol sensor in a benchtop alpha prototype in Phase I. The system will provide BAC, physiological data, wireless data transmission to smart phone/web-based health systems, and will be able to self-calibrate and indicate out of calibration status. The device will be removable and able to operate for up to a year on a single coin cell battery. The Phase I program will provide a clear path to full prototype development and testing in Phase II. This device will provide societal benefits by improved compliance in alcohol abuse treatment, facilitation of public safety, new avenues to long term studies and knowledge in research and clinical settings, and improved general health.

3777,Mobile Technologies Assisting Patients & Family Caregivers in Healthy Living,"This study tests how mobile technologies engage and empower families in healthy living and reduce their home healthcare burden (PAR-11-020). Professionals' real-time home observation of patients via XOOM-EVO motion video and photograph snapshots will provide early detection of the often fatal blood stream sepsis infections and other serious complications of home management of life-long daily home parenteral nutrition (HPN) intravenous (IV) infusions. Millions of dollars are spent annually on poor health associated with complex home-caregiving and on our nation's most costly but preventable diagnosis of IV sepsis, a top 25 NIH research priority. This project will determine the cost-efficiency of mobile technology access to our evidence-based interventions (internet based step-by-step home-caregiving algorithms, video scenes illustrating complex HPN home-care IV procedures and automated prompts and motivating games support families' healthy living activities). Also our XOOM-EVO system (a low cost integrated system using the Motorola XOOM built-in camera computer tablet and the EVO mobile smart phone) uses our multi-point unit or ""bridge"" technology for simultaneous interactions among the family at home and multiple professionals and for peer support groups. Specific aims are to test the effects of the FamHomeCare delivered via XOOM mobile tablet PC & EVO mobile phone with 80 HPN patients and on their caregivers: (a) health status and quality of life; (b) use of healthy living activities; (c) IV infections; (d) caregiver burden; (e) fatigue; and also use of the innovative econometric efficiency statistics of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) will determine the XOOM-EVO system costs, relative to patients' in-person health services. Nested linear mixed model analyses are used to test effects over time. Also, the novel concept of ""Virtual Nurse Caring"" evaluates subjects' (patients and caregivers) sense of being ""cared for"" from a distance via computer tablet telehealth, internet and smart phones. This project will have a sustained impact on: (a) biotechnology, by translating reliable ""best practices"" technology by calculating the cost efficiency of mobile system in ratio to in-person health services used; and (b) clinicians and administrators, by providing new distance care interventions.

3784,Laboratory and field validation of a wrist worn alcohol biosensor among persons living with HIV,"Alcohol use remains common among persons living with HIV (PLWH), creating a significant barrier for mitigating transmission, achieving viral suppression, and reducing comorbidities. Current alcohol interventions are not widely accessed by PLWH and often have limited long-term effects partly due to limited self- management and continuing care outside of clinical settings. The recent development of wearable biosensors provides an unprecedented opportunity for improving alcohol interventions through continuous monitoring and individualized feedback. Currently, the Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitor (SCRAM) ankle bracelet is the only validated transdermal alcohol monitor available on market. It is mainly designed for law enforcement application, and its research application is limited due to its large size, high cost, and social stigma (perceived as house arrested). The newest generation of wrist-worn transdermal alcohol biosensor (BACtrack Skyn) is designed for consumer use. It is light, less expensive, shaped like a fitness wristband, and uses a smartphone app for real-time display. However, this new wrist worn biosensor has not been validated for research use. The overarching goal of this research program is to improve alcohol intervention and eventually related clinical outcomes (e.g., liver function) among HIV+ drinkers through biosensor-assisted intervention. Research shows HIV infection can influence alcohol metabolism (i.e., higher blood alcohol levels), so it's necessary to validate the new alcohol biosensor in HIV+ drinkers in addition to the general population. The primary goal of this project, as a step toward the development and evaluation of a biosensor-assisted alcohol intervention, is to validate the newly available wrist worn transdermal alcohol biosensor (BACtrack Skyn). We propose to recruit 20 HIV+ and 20 HIV- drinkers to validate the Skyn biosensor in both laboratory and real life settings. The two specific aims are: (1) To assess validity and reliability of the Skyn biosensor through comparison with laboratory grade breathalyzer in two fixed-dose lab alcohol administration sessions, and (2) To validate Skyn biosensor in daily life using a 2-week ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and evaluate its usability and acceptability for daily alcohol monitoring. We will also explore factors (e.g., gender, HIV status) that may be associated with individual differences in biosensor readings (e.g., peak, time-to-peak). This project will be the first study to validate the Skyn wrist biosensor and evaluate its utility for research and clinical applications. If the findings confirm the validity, reliability, and usability of the Skyn device, it may fundamentally improve the alcohol and HIV research field with a more reliable, valid, and user-friendly tool for alcohol monitoring and intervention. This study may also provide information on user desired features in a wrist alcohol biosensor and its app to be incorporated in future intervention design. This work will lay the foundation for future projects to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a biosensor-assisted alcohol intervention for HIV+ drinkers to reduce alcohol consumption and eventually improve related clinical and health outcomes.",R21,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9622498,R21AA027191,R21AA027191-01,27191,,,2018,1,2870,Leonie,,,,,,,,,

The candidate currently has 15 mentees including 7 post-doctoral fellows/junior faculty and 8 graduate students. Altogether she has co- authored 119 papers with mentees and they have obtained 17 grants under her mentorship. The proposed mentorship plan will formalize and intensify her mentorship activity by providing mentees with a transdisciplinary mentoring experience that represents experts in behavioral science, preventive cardiology, health informatics, health economics, computer science, and engineering. Mentees from collaborating labs at the UMass Medical School, UMass Amherst, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute will ""embed"" in each other's lab to learn a broad range of mHealth and clinical research skills. Mentees will learn how to: utilize mobile apps and online social networks in their research; analyze online social network data; conduct qualitative data analyses; conduct usability testing; employ behavior change strategies in mobile and social network environments; design preliminary studies; and write grants. The candidate's midcareer training goals are to enhance knowledge and skills in mobile technology and social network analyses, establish a transdisciplinary mentorship program in mHealth research targeting CVD risk reduction, assist mentees to become independent investigators, and ultimately, to contribute to the scientific workforce focused on mHealth solutions for CVD prevention. The overarching goal of the research plan is to test ways to leverage mobile technologies and online social networks to increase the impact, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and dissemination potential of behavioral interventions. Three research aims are proposed, all of which examine the feasibility of novel technology-driven ways to deliver behavior change strategies. The first aim proposes to develop and test the proof-of-concept of a mobile app that will use sensing technology to identify physiological and environmental triggers for overeating. Findings will inform an app designed to identify key moments users would benefit from behavioral support. The second aim is to develop and test the proof-of-concept of a weight loss mobile app that contains an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. The third aim is t test the feasibility of a lifestyle intervention that is delivered via an online social network. Al of the proposed interventions were designed to minimize or eliminate patient visits. This work will provide preliminary data for 3 trials testing the efficacy of these interventions in patient care settings. Identifying cost-effective and scalable means to treat obesity is a public health priorit given the spiraling healthcare costs associated with obesity.

3799,HPV and Cancer mHealth Prevention Education for HIV Positive Women Pilot Study,"The candidate is a research assistant professor with academic training in health promotion, education, and behavior, as well as postdoctoral training in HIV/AIDS prevention, health disparities, and health services research. She also has data management expertise and clinical immunology experience. The candidate has completed two pilot studies that examined HPV infection and cervical cancer prevention knowledge, beliefs and screening behaviors among women living with HIV (WLH). The candidate is seeking additional training needed to develop and implement effective cancer health (including mHealth) communication and community navigation strategies to improve WLH's timely use of cancer screening, diagnostic and treatment services and procedures. The candidate's long-term goal is to obtain extramural research funding for her independent research program focusing on the prevention and control of HPV-mediated cancers among WLH over the next 5-10 years. Promotion to associate professor (tenure- or research-track) is an intermediate goal that the candidate is striving to attain within the next five years. A combination of formal didactic trainig and experiential learning opportunities will be used to acquire cancer prevention and control research skills in the following areas: cancer health (including mHealth) communication, cancer epidemiology, HPV-mediated cancer biology, community navigation, advanced epidemiological research skills (e.g., social epidemiology, n- of-1 research study designs, and, multilevel modeling). The candidate will use the cancer prevention and control research and health communication knowledge and skills acquired through the proposed career development award to conduct formative research needed to inform intervention development in which she will examine cancer health information seeking and sharing among WLH as well as their non-clinical HIV service providers (e.g., HIV/STI risk reduction counselors). Non-clinical HIV service providers will be included because, in addition to the fact that these individuals are already promoting safe sexual practices among WLH, they are also able to reach marginalized groups of WLH such as those who are homeless. This includes sheltered and unsheltered homeless WLH. The candidate's mentors and co-mentors have scientific expertise and community-based participatory research experience that will increase the likelihood of the proposed specific aims being successfully completed. The candidate will first examine HPV-mediated cancer prevention knowledge, beliefs and behaviors, as well as cancer health communication seeking and sharing behaviors (including the use of technology to find health information) (Aim 1). These formative research data will then be used to inform the development (Aim 2) and subsequent pilot testing and evaluation (Aim 3) of an HPV- mediated cancer prevention mHealth education intervention aimed at training WLH who already serve as peer leaders and non-clinical HIV service providers to use mHealth tools and community navigation strategies to disseminate HPV-mediated cancer prevention education. As community navigators, these individuals will use cancer health (including mHealth) communication and community navigation strategies to increase awareness about HPV-mediated cancer risk. This will include promoting cancer risk reducing behaviors such as safe sexual practices and the timely use of recommended cancer screening, diagnostic, and treatment services and procedures). Recall and reminder messages will be sent for screening and follow-up cancer care appointments. User-defined social support messages will also be sent to WLH who may be encountering access to cancer care barriers. The candidate will disseminate the scientific research findings to local, regional, national, and international audiences via presentations that she will give at scientific conferences and annual meetings as well as peer-reviewed publications that she will produce. Most relevant to the candidate's long-term goal of attaining research independence is increasing her number of peer-reviewed publications from her current publication rate of approximately three per year to four or more produced annually by the end of the 5-year training period and the submission of at least one grant proposal (e.g., R01-level funding) by the end of the 5-year training period. The proposed career development/training and research activities will enable the candidate to realize her long-term career goal of becoming an independent cancer researcher with expertise in using cancer health communication, community navigation, and mHealth technologies to address health system failures encountered by vulnerable, medically-underserved WLH along the cancer care continuum. Continued mentoring and opportunities for team science research collaborations will facilitate the candidate's successful progression to being an independent cancer researcher. WLH and non-clinical HIV service providers will be recruited from Ryan White funded clinics and AIDS-service organizations located in urban and rural geographical areas of South Carolina that represent a microcosm of disparities in HIV/AIDS, cancer, and other chronic illness that disproportionately burden medically underserved minority populations. Addressing health system failures that occur along the cancer care continuum that result in missed opportunities to prevent, detect, diagnose and treat HPV-mediated cancers will help to reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality among this high cancer risk, vulnerable group of WLH. The proposed HPV-mediated cancer mHealth prevention education intervention will be conducted in a community-based setting and builds upon an existing academic-community partnership between the candidate and a local AIDS-service organization.

3808,Developing Tailored Delivery and Adherence Interventions for use of Long-Acting Biomedical HIV Prevention Strategies by Transgender Women,"The proposed K01 Award provides the candidate with the skills needed to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator in the field of biomedical HIV prevention focused on transgender women (TW). To do this, the candidate will submit an R01 to develop TW-focused strategies to improve adherence to long-acting HIV prevention products (e.g., cabotegravir injections). However, she must accomplish following training goals: 1) obtain training in the formative work of adherence intervention development within the context of biomedical HIV prevention trials to support the use of long-acting products, 2) gain skills to develop and pilot test an mHealth smartphone app to support adherence to long-acting biomedical HIV prevention strategies, 3) gain experience developing, running, and evaluating trials of behavioral interventions to support the use of biomedical products, and 4) build experience working with TW within the context of HIV prevention research. Training will expand the candidate's ability to integrate behavioral science and biomedical HIV prevention, develop/test adherence interventions that incorporate the appropriate context of participants' lives, and work with a high-risk vulnerable group (TW) to fit HIV prevention tools/interventions to their needs to increase their long-term effectiveness; three key NIH priorities. To do this, the candidate will engage in coursework, directed readings, one-on-one meetings with mentors, hands-on research activities, and completion of an independent research project. TW have unique challenges related to HIV prevention medication adherence. Left unaddressed, these challenges will prevent TW from accessing the promising long-acting HIV prevention tools in the development pipeline. The candidate will develop a replicable process to tailor the delivery of these tools and an adherence intervention (that will include an mHealth app) to the needs of TW, using the example of inert injectable cabotegravir. Work builds on a pilot study (PI: Rael) to identify tailored methods to deliver injectable cabotegravir in TW. The candidate will use qualitative methods (e.g., interviews, group discussions called ""Design Sessions"") to design the adherence intervention and the mHealth app. Then, she will execute a partially randomized patient-preference trial to determine if TW are able to use tailored injection strategies (injection at home or in walk-in clinics) to improve adherence, compared to a control group of TW who will engage a protocol based on HPTN-083/084. This will serve as a ""proof of concept"" for the future R01 that will test this on a larger scale. Research and training will take place at NYSPI/Columbia, in affiliation with, 1) Project AFFIRM, a study of transgender identity (R01HD079603; PI: Bockting), that will provide infrastructure for critical research activities (e.g., recruitment), and 2) SLAP-HIV, a clinical trial to produce a long-acting form of cabotegravir (e.g., injection; UM1 AI120184; PI: Hope). SLAP-HIV will provide clinical oversight (e.g., ensure tailored delivery strategies are feasible) and the opportunity to interface with a clinical trial.

3818,Enhanced Clinical Decisions for Management of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Using Patient-Reported Outcomes,"The American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) has been the primary patient-reported outcome (PRO) used in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for decades; however, it is not a comprehensive assessment of lower urinary tract symptoms that may present with BPH because it lacks items on urinary incontinence and bladder pain. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) developed general-use multidimensional symptom questionnaires in order to address the complex needs of the urology clinic, but these tools have yet to be validated in specific clinical populations. The overarching goal of this project is to use these questionnaires and other PROs to enhance clinical decision-making in men with BPH. This will be achieved by (1) integration of PRO assessments into the evaluation and management of patients with BPH; (2) determination of clinically meaningful differences in LURN Symptom Indices in men with BPH receiving known effective treatment; and (3) creation of care-coordination recommendations to facilitate using PROs in order to match evidence-based treatments to patients with persistent symptoms. PROs are a cost- effective strategy that, combined with advances in electronic medical health record technology, can improve patient care by allowing for more real-time surveillance and intervention, including the monitoring of both the core urologic symptoms of BPH and common comorbid symptoms such as sleep disturbance and depression. In order to effectively determine meaningful symptom changes in response to treatment, minimally important differences specific to men with BPH must be established. Moreover, previously demonstrated convergent validity of the questionnaires must be confirmed in this population. In addition to using PROs to assess treatment response, they can also be used to monitor short-term side effects and comorbid conditions over the course of treatment, a practice that can facilitate care coordination that will increase quality of care and quality of life for men with BPH. In Aim 1, we will use statistical methods to predict changes in urologic symptoms and assess associations between lower urinary tract symptoms and measures of sleep disturbance, depression, and pain, among others. In Aim 2, we will assess test-retest reliability and other psychometric properties of the LURN Symptom Indices, using a triangulation of methods to determine minimally important differences. In Aim 3, we will engage stakeholders, including patients and clinicians, and use qualitative methods to create care coordination checklists intended for physician extenders to follow up with patients undergoing treatment, including via telehealth. Aim 3 will also enhance the recovery and routine monitoring of men with BPH after surgery, who can experience distressing side effects and complications such as urinary leakage and pain. The ultimate result of this work will be better understanding of the associations between comorbid sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, etc., with urinary symptoms in men with BPH, and improved care and reduced symptom burden through the integration of robust and validated PROs into multiple phases of urologic care.",R01,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10521461,R01DK130963,R01DK130963-01A1,130963,A1,,2022,1,2904,Pablo,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3826,Integration of Trusted Adult Supports into the HealthMpowerment App to Improve Black Adolescent and Young Adult PrEP Use,"Through lived experiences and my position as an adolescent medicine physician, I have witnessed the lifelong consequences that disparities in health outcomes impose on vulnerable adolescents and young adults (AYAs). This has fueled my long-term goal of developing interventions that empower AYAs, providers, and adults who support AYA acquisition of skills that positively impact all aspects of sexual health, including HIV prevention. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV, a daily or intermittently dosed oral pill, has been shown to be a highly effective biomedical tool for preventing HIV infection. However, the benefits of PrEP have not been experienced equally among all populations with HIV acquisition risk. In particular, PrEP use and adherence rates are low among Blacks, especially Black adolescents and young adults (AYAs), which may explain the disproportionate rates of HIV in many Black communities. Although there are many barriers to PrEP use and adherence among Blacks, including low perception of risk; challenges adhering to a pill regimen and visit schedule; and HIV- and sex-related stigma, few solutions have been shown to improve PrEP use in this population, especially among Black AYAs. An intervention that increases PrEP adherence may be of particular importance for Black AYAs in the Deep South, particularly in states such as Alabama, which has been named a geographic hotspot in the Department of Health and Human Service's Ending the HIV Epidemic 10-year plan. Grounded in Social Cognitive Theory, and building on previously published data, this proposed study will integrate AYA-trusted adult social support dyadic communication with an existing mobile Health (mHealth) app-the HealthMpowerment app-to facilitate increased PrEP use and adherence among Black AYAs in the Deep South. As more than half of new HIV infections in Alabama occur in rural communities, we will collaborate with community partners within urban and rural areas and create two community advisory boards, one with Black AYAs and one with adults providing support to Black AYAs, to ensure this app fits the needs of urban and rural Black AYAs. Specifically, this multi- methods study will use qualitative interviews and discrete choice experiment surveys to identify 1) trusted adults Black AYAs would ideally partner with, 2) what information trusted adult supports would need to support Black AYAs in PrEP adherence, and 3) app features that Black AYAs and their trusted adult supports feel would best support dyadic communication around AYA PrEP use. After adaptation, the app will be piloted by Black AYAs 14 to 21 years old to inform an application for R34 funding of a larger pilot study. If validated in future clinical trials, this intervention could prove helpful in alleviating disparities in HIV incidence. In addition to providing a tailored health intervention, the comprehensive experiential training, expert mentorship and advising, and critical didactic coursework embodied in this rigorous proposal will build on my clinical expertise and strong background building community partnerships and provide the additional skills I need to become a leader in the development of health behavior interventions focused on reducing disparities in sexual and reproductive health outcomes.",K23,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10483485,K23MH128128,K23MH128128-01A1,128128,A1,,2022,1,2912,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,

A DualPump™ will be developed in which one proprietary ePump® body will independently and accurately deliver both insulin and glucagon from two separate reservoirs. Latching safety valve sets will independently and safely control the delivery of each hormone and a dispense confirmation sensor will notify the user of any dosing errors resulting from occlusions or electrical/mechanical failures. Phase II will see the integration of all components into an accurate, discrete, low-profile wearable pod, extensive benchtop testing and initial testing in swine. The end goal of Phase II is production of a DualPump module that has been introduced to the FDA and is ready to be integrated with all other components required for a dual hormone artificial pancreas. During Phase IIB, SFC Fluidics will work with manufacturers of continuous glucose monitors, control algorithms and stable drug formulations to develop an FDA-approved, robust, and reliable dual hormone artificial pancreas.",R44,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,9554687,R44DK110972,R44DK110972-02,110972,,,2018,2,2913,Tom,,,,,,,,,
3831,"A Wearable Ultrasonic System for Automatic, Continuous, and Noninvasive Monitoring of Central Blood Pressure","This proposed project aims to develop a wearable ultrasonic patch for automatic, continuous, and noninvasive central blood pressure monitoring. Hypertension is a ""silent killer"" since it gradually induces a series of cardiovascular diseases, usually without any obvious symptoms. Compared with brachial blood pressure acquired by the cuff, blood pressure at central locations has been proven to be more valuable for predicting future cardiovascular events and disease risks. Thus, it is essential to measure central blood pressure regularly to maximize the blood pressure management outcome. This research is distinct from all other existing methods for central blood pressure measurements that have a series of different technical challenges, such as the use of invasive procedures, insufficient accuracy, and significant dependence on the operator's skills. In 2018, the PI's group invented the first wearable ultrasonic device for central blood pressure recording, supported by an R21 grant from NIH. However, this device still needs cables for power and data transfer, manual processing of the data, and a low signal-to-noise ratio. In this proposed project, we will demonstrate a wearable ultrasonic transducer array integrated with miniaturized wireless control electronics and automatic data processing algorithms. The integrated control electronics will eliminate the bulky setup and connecting wires. The phased-array beamforming will focus and steer the ultrasound beam to search the blood vessels and improve the signal-to-noise ratio and the spatial resolution. All data acquired by the wearable ultrasonic device will be wirelessly transmitted to a terminal receiver (e.g., a smartphone), where a deep learning based algorithm is running for further data processing. The customized algorithm will automatically localize the targeted artery and track both the anterior and posterior walls of the vessel without the supervision of human operators. Thereby, the operator dependence in conventional ultrasound systems will be eliminated, and device usability can be much improved. Finally, the proposed entire system will be validated on patients against arterial catheterization, the current gold standard for central blood pressure monitoring in clinical settings. If successful, this proposed study will provide patients with a device that can access their central blood pressure automatically, continuously, and noninvasively. Using a stretchable platform that matches the softness of the human skin will make a key difference in patient acceptance and monitoring outcomes. The ease of measurements enabled by the automatic algorithm can significantly help high-throughput screening of central blood pressure in the general population and guide the development of antihypertensive drugs, which can eventually translate to a significant reduction in blood pressure associated mortality and healthcare costs.",R01,EB,NIBIB,EB,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10504949,R01EB033464,R01EB033464-01,33464,,,2022,1,2918,Josh,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3832,"SBIR phase II: A personalized, non-invasive hemoglobin level monitoring and management platform for chronic anemia patients.","Anemia, characterized by low blood hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, is the world's most common blood disorder, afflicting nearly two billion people, with 80 million at high risk in the US alone. Due to numerous etiologies, anemia can also be chronic and potentially life-threatening. Given the severity and epidemiological impact of anemia, screening is crucial for those at risk for anemia, and those with diagnosed chronic anemia require frequent monitoring. Currently, the gold-standard diagnostic test for anemia is the complete blood count (CBC), which requires a patient visit to a clinic/hospital or commercial lab as well as trained phlebotomists/technicians. However, access to this test is cost-prohibitive and inconvenient. Due to the inconvenience, and cost associated with CBCs, point-of-care (POC) Hgb diagnostics have been developed, but current systems all suffer from high-cost (handheld Hgb meters cost USD $30-$1000), or inaccuracy, and no non-invasive, inexpensive, easily accessible over the counter (OTC) anemia diagnostic exists that accurately measures a patient's Hgb levels, especially as a patient self-test. To address these critical challenges, Sanguina, Inc has developed a novel, multi-faceted anemia screening and monitoring suite of products comprising 3 key products 1) AnemoCheck for home use - a ""single drop of blood"" fingerstick test that utilizes our FDA-cleared technology to elicit a color change that correlates to Hgb levels, 2) AnemoCheck Mobile - a smartphone app that screens for anemia using only smartphone photos and the phone's native hardware and 3) AnemoCheck MyMobile, a marriage of the Home and Mobile products in which the app is calibrated with the AnemoCheck blood test to significantly improve the apps accuracy and personalize Hgb level results. These technologies have been published in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals (Tyburski et at., JCI 2014, Mannino et al, Nature Communications 2018). The goal of this Phase II SBIR is to finalize AnemoCheck MyMobile, Sanguina has leveraged the ubiquity of smartphones and the familiarity of fingerpick-based self-testing to develop a paradigm shifting platform for managing anemia at home and maintaining wellness, as demanded by people at the highest risk for anemia. The goals of this Phase II SBIR are to validate the AnemoCheck MyMobile platform for management of anemia in chronic anemic patients, which was developed utilizing phase I SBIR funding. We will leverage our collaborations with co-PI and co-I's Robert Sidonio, MD, Wilbur Lam, MD, PhD, and Traci Leong, PhD of Emory University School of Medicine to conduct our clinical validation on a cohort of bleeding disorder, hemolytic anemia, sickle cell disease and hemoglobinopathy patients with chronic anemia, and healthy individuals.

3837,Geospatial modeling for stroke care,"Acute Ischemic stroke (AIS) remains the leading cause of disability in the US. Large vessel occlusion (LVO) represents up to 20% of all ischemic strokes, but causes 90% of stroke-related death and severe disability. Both intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular therapy (EVT) are effective time-sensitive treatments to prevent stroke-related morbidity and mortality. EVT is highly effective for LVOs, does not provide any benefit in non-LVO strokes and is available in less than 20% of US stroke centers. IVT is readily available, has a modest effect for LVOs and is the only therapeutic alternative for non-LVO strokes. The challenge for paramedics is to expedite EVT for eligible patients without harming a large proportion of non-qualified patients in need of IVT, in the context of initial diagnostic uncertainty. The current system triage criteria have lagged behind emerging therapies available to the sickest subset, and the disparity in stroke outcomes is exacerbated in rural areas and for ethnic minorities. Herein, we propose a study to foster the development of an innovative geospatial triage algorithm of stroke care in the U.S. health system through a multidisciplinary collaboration to maximize neurological recovery to all stroke patients. The model will be constructed to provide optimal predicted outcomes for individual patients, using a Bayesian framework to inform each link of the treatment decision tree, building on prior studies while overcoming their limitations and closing the implementation gap. First, the patient outcome model will be built using individual and hospital level data randomized trials, which will enable a context sensitive triage decision algorithm without reliance on overbroad assumptions about the treatment pathway. We will uniquely incorporate uncertainty through modelling of individual level data in a Bayesian framework, rather than relying on point estimates at an aggregate level. Additionally, our model will be adaptable; we will be able to incorporate emerging LVO diagnostic tools with improved diagnostic accuracy, as well as new therapeutic strategies as the stroke field evolves. Furthermore, the conditional structure will allow the modification of facility capabilities, including the introduction of new EVT-capable stroke centers. The clinical and cost-benefit algorithm impact will be assessed by comparing with the current real-world triage by incorporating local stroke center and EVT-capable center data on stroke flow metrics from Get-With-The Guidelines-Stroke registry to better estimate the probability of good outcomes and improve triage capabilities. Finally, the triage algorithm will be integrated into a point-of-care decision tool support readily available for all EMS to recommend the optimal destination for all the entire stroke population after their initial assessment. After appropriate refinement and adequate implementation in subsequent studies, this tool will not only have the potential to optimize stroke outcomes, but also reduce the actual geographic and racial disparities in the U.S.",R01,NS,NINDS,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10432727,R01NS127114,R01NS127114-01,127114,,,2022,1,2924,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3840,Sanford Community Cancer Program of the North Central Plains,"The rural communities of the upper Midwest and Central Plains represent a large underserved population for cancer treatment, care delivery and clinical trials. The causes of this difference are multi-factorial but a main obstacle is access to services in rural regional areas. Sanford Health has developed a network of hospitals, cancer centers and clinics to provide high quality multi-disciplinary cancer treatment, clinical trials, ad cancer care delivery to this underserved area. It is hypothesized that this disparity in care for this rural population can be improved by utilizing the organized Sanford Community Cancer Program (SCCP) network community. This proposal describes the NCI NCORP partnership to help deliver clinical trials and cancer care delivery across the rural area the SCCP serves. This will be accomplished through the following aims: 1. /Maintain and enhance robust accrual to NCI Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) supported clinical trials through our five primary components. 2. Address disparities in clinical trial accrual in underserved and underrepresented populations to increase participation. 3. Cultivate Innovative access points to address barriers to clinical trial accrual through outreach and telemedicine. 4. Develop a Cancer Care Delivery infrastructure.

3855,Usability and Feasibility of a Phone-based Decision Support Tool for Option B+,"Despite the availability of low-cost, efficacious interventions to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission (pMTCT), and significant investments to increase their availability, the translation of scientific advances into practice has been sub-optimal. In highly affected regions in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA), HIV-infected pregnant women navigate a complex, sequential cascade of pMTCT services. Due to this complex care cascade, pediatric HIV infection remains largely uncontrolled, including in Mozambique and Kenya. To simplify the cascade and improve pMTCT, the World Health Organization (WHO) released updated guidelines in 2013 to include ""Option B+"", in which HIV-infected women initiate life-long anti-retroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy regardless of CD4 count. Option B+ was adopted in Mozambique and Kenya in 2014, but initial results show sub-optimal ARV adherence and retention. Multiple health system challenges to Option B+ implementation exist; including the need to support the expanded role of nurses in service management and clinical care of Option B+ eligible mother-infant pairs. Decision-support tools tailored to nurses are needed to help their identification of systems inefficiencies and solutions across the HIV care cascade. As part of a cluster randomized trial of a systems analysis and improvement approach to assess and iteratively improve pMTCT in three sSA countries, we developed and evaluated an Excel(r)-based pMTCT cascade analysis tool (PCAT) that provides a systems-level view for nurses to rapidly and independently track patient flow through the pMTCT cascade. When combined with continuous quality improvement, the intervention was associated with a 4-5 fold greater rate of increase in coverage of maternal ARV provision and HIV-exposed infant screening. But the PCAT's usability was inhibited by low computer availability and literacy, and use was led by study nurses rather than facility personnel. Option B+-specific steps (e.g. retention in care and adherence), were also not part of the PCAT. Provider decision- support tools that are easily managed by health workers are more acceptable, usable and have more potential to improve management of complex health services. Tools tailored to specific environments with engagement from clinic staff are more likely to be implemented. In this study, we plan to adapt and refine a beta-tested version of a phone-based PCAT application, and test its usability and feasibility in Mozambique and Kenya. This study will collect preliminary data to inform a larger, controlled trial of the mobile PCAT application for Option B+ (mPCAT) and build capacity to conduct this trial in both countries. Aims include: 1) Identify Option B+-specific cascade measures and incorporate into the mPCAT; 2) Assess the usability of the mPCAT among nurses experienced with systems analysis and improvement for Option B+; 3) Feasibility test the mPCAT as part of a broader systems analysis and improvement approach.",R21,AI,NIAID,AI,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9116602,R21AI124399,R21AI124399-01,124399,,,2016,1,2943,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3871,"Novel, Ambulatory Cuff-less Non-invasive Arterial Blood Pressure Monitor","The objective of this proposal is to complete the engineering development and testing of the Non-Invasive Self- calibrating Ambulatory Multi-Modality (NISAM) blood pressure device to recognize hypertensive patients not currently identified using today's technology. As well as providing better management of hypertensive patients by presenting a truer round-the-clock picture of their blood pressure (BP) variation. Hypertension is increasing worldwide and represents an annual burden of $47.5 billion in healthcare costs and resources in addition to $3.5 billion yearly in lost productivity. In the U.S. 80 million people have hypertension, though only 80% are aware of their condition, and only 48% have it adequately controlled. As with every disease state, proper measurement of the problem is required. Patient BP varies throughout the day, week and year. Existing in- clinic BP measurements are infrequent and prone to errors. The NISAM device combines four different sensor technologies into a wearable wireless non-invasive BP measurement device that does not require an inflation cuff. The device is worn over the patient's brachial artery near the elbow At only 3 cm x 3 cm it is small, unobtrusive and easy to use. The device monitors patient movement and uses this information to assess when to collect data. It can store months and up to years of data and wirelessly transmit this to a smart phone or to a hospital's electronic medical records system. The NISAM device's clinical benefits include: an unobtrusive BP measurement system to identify hypertensive patients not currently recognized using today's methods, as well as better managing existing hypertensive patients by understanding their true BP variation. Also, the NISAM device will display the BP data to support clinically actionable decisions through patient-specific, efficient and easy to understand diagnostic reports. In addition, patient compliance is greatly improved because this device does not require an inflation cuff, which is disruptive to patient's sleep. In this Phase I proposal we will demonstrat feasibility and complete engineering development and testing of the NISAM BP sensors and actuator system, and compare measurements with a standard clinical BP cuff in bench/mock and human testing. To achieve this objective a mock artery setup will be used to demonstrate performance and accuracy using the force actuator and four different sensor techniques. Also, prototypes will be built to measure the accuracy of the four sensors on human subjects and compare results to inflation cuff systems. The long-term goal is to clinically utilize the NISAM device to better identify and manage hypertensive patients, using a small, wearable, wireless easy to use BP device.",R43,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8839117,R43HL126424,R43HL126424-01,126424,,,2015,1,2959,Tom,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
3884,Dynamically Tailoring Interventions for Problem-Solving in Diabetes Self-Management Using Self-Monitoring Data - a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"In this project, we will evaluate the efficacy of a novel approach to tailoring behavioral interventions for self-management of type 2 diabetes to individuals' behavioral and glycemic profiles discovered using computational learning and self-monitoring data. Growing evidence suggests significant differences in individuals' physiology and glycemic function, and their cultural, social, and economical circumstances that impact diabetes self-management. These discoveries highlight the need for personally tailoring both medical treatment and behavioral interventions. Yet tailored behavioral interventions proposed thus far typically focus on motivation for behavior change and individuals' psycho-social characteristics, rather than personalizing self-management strategies, such as changes in diet and physical activity. Moreover, tailoring typically relies on expert identification of tailoring variables and decision rules, and on standard surveys for assessment these variables. Data collected with self- monitoring can more accurately reflect an individual's behaviors and glycemic patterns, thus highlighting their ""behavioral phenotypes"", yet such data are rarely utilized in tailoring. The ongoing focus of this research is on developing informatics interventions for diabetes self- management, with a specific focus on personal discovery with self-monitoring data and on problem-solving for improving glycemic control. In the proposed research we will introduce GlucoType that relies on computational pattern analysis of data collected with self-monitoring technologies to identify behavioral patterns associated with poor glycemic control and formulate personalized behavioral goals for changing problematic behaviors. In our preliminary studies we have established that 1) computational phenotyping methods can accurately identify systematic associations between individuals' activities and changes in BG levels; 2) these patterns can be automatically translated into behavioral goals formulated in a natural language in a way consistent with goals formulated by diabetes experts, and 3) individuals with T2DM can understand and follow these behavioral goals and engage with GlucoType for personal self- management of diabetes.

3887,Illinois Precision Medicine Consortium (IPMC),"This is a collaborative multi-PI, multi-site application from the Illinois Precision Medicine Consortium (IPMC) to serve as a Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) Cohort Program HPO Enrollment Center. IPMC comprises 3 major Chicago-area academic institutions (Northwestern University, University of Chicago, and the University of Illinois at Chicago) and their healthcare provider organization (HPO) partners across Illinois. Our overall scientific goal is to recruit and examine a large and diverse cohort of individuals across all age groups from both sexes, including both healthy people and those with pre-existing diseases (without regard to specific disease type), and to follow them through innovative mobile health technologies, electronic health records (EHR), and health insurance claims data to enable linkage of genetic and environmental exposures with a broad array of health outcomes. The consortium brings together extensive preexisting research resources across the 3 academic institutions, as well as the widespread, yet geographically distinct, service areas of their HPO partners representing numerous ethnically and socioeconomically diverse Chicago and Illinois communities. Specific Aims for the UG3 Phase (Year 01) are: Aim 1. Study goals: Recruit, consent, examine, collect biospecimens, and transmit curated data and processed biosamples to the PMI Coordinating and Biobanking Centers, on at least 10,000 people from diverse ethnic, social, and economic backgrounds who are patients in one of the 3 Illinois area HPOs (and their affiliates). Aim 2. Pilot projects: Conduct a series of recruitment pilot studies in the participating HPO settings, with detailed tracking of success rates, including percentage participation and diversity of participation, and from these studies discern the most effective recruitment strategies for each participating HPO. Aim 3. Milestones: Meet our stated milestones that demonstrate our success in reaching short-term goals for organization, participation in national planning, and successful recruitment and logistics. Aim 4. Collaboration: Collaborate with other PMI sites in protocol development, Steering Committee (SC) and other committee engagement to plan for success of the overall PMI.

3888,Laser Speckle Imaging Chip for Telehealth Applications,"The availability of improved diagnostic tools in the primary care environment capable of diagnosing diseases in their earliest stages could significantly improve disease management. Primary beneficiaries would be the elderly, who are at increased risk for a number of progressively debilitating diseases, but who may face practical cost and convenience hurdles in routinely presenting to specialists for examination. Retinal imaging is increasingly being recognized as a means to monitor not just ophthalmic health, but also as a surrogate indicator of neurological and cardiovascular health. And therefore, there is increasing support for its integration into primary care practice via telehealth approaches. However, current retinal imaging products that meet the cost, size, and use case requirements of the primary care environment have significant limitations in their abilities such as their inadequacy to measure blood flow or other dynamic changes in physiology. To address this shortcoming of current technology and make a clinical impact, Vasoptic has proposed to develop and commercialize a low-cost, portable, noninvasive retinal imaging instrument (the XyCAM) that can complement fundus photographs with retinal blood flow information obtained at high spatio-temporal resolution without the introduction of any dyes. During Phase I studies, we designed and developed a custom image sensing chip with high signal to noise ratio, as needed for the low-light retinal imaging application, and developed a handheld prototype with a robust software suite for image acquisition and analysis. Upon confirming safety against light toxicity, we characterized performance of the XyCAM prototype by conducting proof-of-concept experiments in animal models and proof-of-feasibility studies in human subjects. Our investigation has indicated that the XyCAM prototype can image retinal blood flow with a high spatio- temporal resolution and with high reproducibility. Based on this success and our learnings, we propose a Phase II effort which will include (a) development and validation of robust mechanisms to automatically and objectively assess the vascular status in the retina; and (b) demonstration of preliminary feasibility that the XyCAM can discriminate between normal and diseased retinas through point-of-care assessment of retinal blood flow and associated morphological and physiological metrics. Our Phase II application focuses on two disease conditions that affect the elderly and severely impact their quality of life - Alzheimer's disease, which is also the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and diabetic retinopathy, which causes as many as 65,000 individuals to experience serious visual impairment every year. While the former could also benefit from research carried out in primary care environments leading to the development of retinal blood flow as a robust biomarker for diagnostics, the latter could benefit from increased patient compliance and early diagnostics as is possible through telehealth methods. If we are successful, this study will enable a 510(k) submission to the US FDA seeking approval to market the validated XyCAM as a general purpose retinal imager and provide us the necessary early feasibility data that justifies multi-center clinical trials to investigate the sensitivity and specificity for various disease diagnostics.",R44,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,9466379,R44AG048758,R44AG048758-03,48758,,,2017,3,2977,Josh,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3895,Mindfulness-based Smoking Cessation Enhanced with Mobile Technology for Low-Income Smokers,"Tobacco use, a primary behavioral risk factor for cancer, is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Adults with low socioeconomic status (SES) and members of certain racial/ethnic minority groups are less likely to quit and consequently experience profound tobacco-related cancer disparities. There is an urgent need to improve upon evidence-based smoking cessation interventions to better serve these populations. Mindfulness training substantially increases rates of smoking cessation and lapse recovery. There is a dearth of research on mindfulness in low-SES and racial/ethnic minority groups, but these interventions do show promise for smoking cessation in these populations. However, additional between-session support may be needed for these smokers, who experience significant day-to-day barriers to quitting and have lower access to smoking cessation resources. Mobile health technology (mHealth) could provide vital 24/7 support for low- SES smokers. For example, personalized, interactive mHealth messages might encourage participants to use mindfulness and other smoking cessation techniques in the moments when they need them most (e.g., in times of high stress or craving), thus enhancing treatment effectiveness. Based on iterative feedback from low- SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers, we developed a text messaging program (""iQuit Mindfully"") as an adjunct to in-person mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment. Our pilot work demonstrates that iQuit Mindfully is feasible, acceptable, and perhaps most effective for low-SES smokers (i.e., 23.1% of participants living in poverty who received iQuit Mindfully achieved abstinence at end of treatment and 1-month follow-up, while none of those living in poverty quit in the in-person-only treatment). Building on this pilot work, we will incorporate participant feedback to further increase interactivity and personalization so that iQuit Mindfully can more flexibly adapt to participants' changing needs. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Test the efficacy of a mindfulness-based smoking cessation intervention enhanced by mHealth (iQuit Mindfully), compared to in- person mindfulness-based addiction treatment (MBAT) and usual care; and 2) Investigate the mechanisms through which MBAT and iQuit Mindfully impact smoking cessation using intensive daily diary assessment. This project aims to improve cessation outcomes for low-SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers by supplementing existing mindfulness treatment with innovative mHealth methods. Furthermore, we aim to advance the scientific study of mechanisms of action of mindfulness treatment, which could inform the development of more efficacious and efficient treatments to reduce tobacco-related cancer disparities.",R01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9711925,R01CA237004,R01CA237004-01,237004,,,2019,1,2984,Josh,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
3921,Feasibility of mHealth technology-enabled service for remote observed therapy of methadone and COVID-19 screening for patients in an opioid treatment program,"Methadone remains a cornerstone of treatment for opioid use disorders (OUD). Daily or frequent supervised treatment with visual confirmation of ingestion (directly-observed therapy or ""DOT""), is the standard of care for methadone treatment in federally licensed opioid treatment programs (OTPs) in the United States. DOT ensures adherence and mitigates the risk of medication poisonings and diversion; however, these same policies present major challenges to infection control. The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred initiatives to increase the number of non-observed take-home doses. Remote systems for monitoring DOT of methadone and screening of patients for COVID-19 are desperately needed by OTPs: the emocha mobile health provides a solution. Specific Aim #1 is to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and outcomes of an innovative mHealth platform to deliver asynchronous video-based DOT services plus COVID-19 symptom screening via smartphone for patients receiving methadone at an opioid treatment program that was implemented rapidly in response to COVID-19. In order to provide remote supervision and recovery support for patients with extended take-home doses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Evergreen Treatment Services (ETS) rapidly implemented emocha's video DOT pilot program for patients on methadone for OUD on April 16, 2020 and enrolled 38 patients within 2 weeks. We will conduct a retrospective, observational study of patients who utilized the video-DOT/symptom screening app during this pilot. Specific Aim #2 is to evaluate usability and user experiences of the innovative mHealth platform to deliver asynchronous video-based DOT services plus COVID-19 symptom screening via smartphone for patients receiving methadone at an opioid treatment program that was rapidly implemented in response to COVID-19. A usability study will be conducted with subsets of ""high-use"", ""medium-use"" and ""low-use"" patients who participated in the pilot and the five counselors who offered the app and used the app's web-based clinician-facing portal. The researchers will conduct usability testing sessions to objectively measure the duration of time and number of errors associated with completing video-DOT tasks and will obtain subjective ratings of the difficulty and helpfulness of video-DOT tasks and features. This Phase I research will well-position the team to submit a grant for Phase II in order to measure efficacy and further develop the model for business sustainability, which will allow for rapid translation to other OTPs.",R41,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10156384,R41DA053081,R41DA053081-01,53081,,,2020,1,3014,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
3927,Tailored Adaptive Mobile Messaging to Reduce Problem Drinking,"The proposed R01, entitled, Tailored Adaptive Mobile Messaging to Reduce Problem Drinking, is submitted to expand on our recently completed R34 grant entitled, Tailored Mobile Messaging to Reduce Problem Drinking (R34AA021502). Despite significant consequences, heavy drinking individuals with non abstinence goals rarely seek treatment. Newer methods such as internet screening and mobile apps provide opportunities to engage and treat this difficult to reach population. We recently completed an R34 study where we developed the first automated comprehensive tailored adaptive (TA) text messaging intervention for problem drinking (PD). We compared TA to different types of automated once a day messaging including: baseline tailored only messaging (TO), loss framed messaging (LF), gain frame messaging (GF), and weekly mobile assessment only (MA). This was done over 12 weeks in a sample of 171 problem drinkers recruited on the internet across the US. All messaging groups outperformed MA on most drinking outcomes, and the TA group had the largest effect sizes on every drinking outcome with an average weekly drink reduction of 9 standard drinks and a reduction of 2 heavy drinking days a week at week 12. Over an 8- month period, 1149 individuals took the web-based screening survey, highlighting the demand for messaging in this population. This study provides initial evidence of the effectiveness of messaging to reduce PD in help-seeking adults across the country. Large scale randomized controlled trials are needed to provide the necessary empirical evidence to validate SMS interventions and to understand moderators of outcome for help seeking heavy drinkers. In a large scale R01 trial, we propose to compare the Tailored Adaptive messaging group (TA; N=300) to the baseline Tailored Only group (TO; N=300) and the weekly Mobile Assessment only group (MA; N=300). All groups will receive messages for a six month period. Participants will complete self-report web-based assessments at Baseline, 1-Month, 3-Months, 6-Months, 12-Months and 18-Months. Participants across conditions will receive weekly MA for 26 weeks. We hypothesize that TA will be superior to MA on all drinking measures at all time periods and TA will outperform TO at all time periods except one month follow-up. Other aims include testing baseline moderators such as alcohol severity and mediators such as message relevance. Overall, if study aims are achieved, we will: 1) have empirical support that TA is an effective intervention for PD and its effects are durable over time; 2) understand whether receiving baseline only tailoring is sufficient or if adaptive tailoring is needed for long-term behavior change; 3) understand the moderators and mediators of outcome in messaging interventions for PD; and 4) be able to disseminate an empirically-supported direct to consumer mobile intervention for PD to anyone with a mobile phone who is not ready to seek in-person care.",R01,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9310626,R01AA025058,R01AA025058-01A1,25058,A1,,2017,1,3021,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3929,Improving the HIV testing experience for YMSM,"Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are the only risk group with a rising incidence of HIV infection, yet a high proportion of HIV-infected YMSM are unaware of their seropositive status. HIV testing is the critical first component of HIV prevention and care. Individuals who are aware of their infection can begin treatment, which can reduce the likelihood of onward transmission and improve clinical outcomes. Barriers to testing among youth-including YMSM-include perception of low risk, fear of testing positive, concerns about confidentiality and accessibility to health services. Virtual reality (VR) and intelligent virtual agent technologies can provide youth with the ability to ""experience"" all aspecs of the testing process thus overcoming many of the basic barriers to access and effective care. VR can offer realistic sensory cues such as sounds, sights, and rich, interactive dialogue that would be expected to elicit more affect in YMSM than simply watching a video vignette. Our project, ""Test Rehearsal: Maximizing the HIV Testing Experience for YMSM,"" will create a secure, internet-delivered software program, available by mobile devices that will offer character-driven realistic scenarios that are engaging, interactive, ecologically sensitive, and user-centric in content and design allowing youth to actively experience the HIV testing process in a non-threatening and non-stigmatizing environment. Test Rehearsal is theoretically grounded within the Information, Motivation and Behavioral (IMB) model and will be a novel and high impact prevention tool to address the lack of uptake of HIV testing among YMSM 14-19 years of age. This project builds logically on previous work including VR cue exposure for health- related behaviors, creation and testing of VR technology for at-risk youth (i.e. HIV, substance use), formative work and content development with the target population (i.e. disclosure of HIV status among HIV+ YMSM) and creation, development and testing of mHealth interventions for YMSM (including those focused on linkage and retention in care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy). The goals of this Phase I SBIR are to develop and evaluate content of a complete VR affect-inducing HIV self-testing scenario informed by both online and in-person focus-groups with 24-32 YMSM, and to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the prototype with 12-15 YMSM who are not frequent testers. If successful, Phase II will support the full development of Test Rehearsal, a complete, mHealth HIV testing and linkage to care intervention for YMSM. The intervention will include introductory assessment modules (e.g., that educate on the benefits of testing, types of tests available (e.g. self-testing clinic, couples counseling), skill-based tools designed to facilitate more open communication around testing including discussions of sexual risk among users and testing providers, and feedback modules based on intelligent virtual agent-driven practice scenarios to aid youth in making testing decisions and experiencing the testing process.",R43,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9146528,R43HD088319,R43HD088319-01,88319,,,2016,1,3023,Chris,,,,,,,,,
3940,Privacy-protecting distributed analysis of biomedical big data,"Advances in technology, bioinformatics, and data science have made it possible to analyze large and complex databases to generate evidence that improves public health and accelerates the development of precision medicine. However, the advent of big data has also raised concerns about privacy and confidentiality. This application is focused on data privacy in vertically partitioned data, a data environment where information about an individual is available in two or more data sources. This type of data structure is common in biomedical research and is expected to grow exponentially as information from the same individual is increasingly collected in multiple sources, such as insurance claims databases, electronic health records, registries, social media, wearables, and mobile devices. Combining multiple databases provides a more complete health profile about the patient and generates more robust evidence. However, concerns about data privacy, confidentiality, and security, and constraints in governance and institutional agreements make it highly challenging or sometimes impossible to physically pool different data sources. We propose to develop an open-source, freely available software tool that will employ a cutting-edge method - distributed regression - to analyze vertically partitioned datasets. The method does not require data to be combined physically, but produces statistically equivalent results as if the datasets were linked and pooled centrally at one site. Instead of sharing patient-level information, participating sites will only transfer non-identifiable information matrix (a design matrix used in fitting of statistical models) and other summary-level statistics needed in the statistical modeling process. This approach offers much greater protection for data privacy while allowing one to perform sophisticated statistical analysis. The software tool will be developed, tested, and fine-tuned using both simulated datasets and the real-world data from Optum Labs, which houses one of the largest vertically partitioned datasets in the U.S. with claims and electronic health record data from over 5 million patients. The tool will be made compatible with PopMedNetTM, an open-source data-sharing platform currently used by several large national initiatives such as the NIH Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory Distributed Research Network, the PCORI-funded National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), and the FDA-funded Sentinel program. The tool is therefore highly scalable and can have immediate impacts on real-world big data analysis. The multidisciplinary study team includes researchers who pioneered some of the distributed regression approaches and experts who have extensive experience in multi-center studies. The distributed regression method has great potential to shift the paradigm of multi-center big biomedical research, from transferring of potentially identifiable patient-level data to the sharing of non-identifiable summary-level information. The proposed software tool will be a major step towards real-world application of this state-of-the-art privacy-protecting analytic approach.",U01,EB,NIBIB,OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9159815,U01EB023683,U01EB023683-01,23683,,,2016,1,3034,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
3943,Multi-Media Parent-based Intervention to Promote Dental Hygiene Among Young Children: BeReady2Smile,"Project Description Approximately one out of three 2- to 5-year-old children in the United States has experienced caries (tooth decay). The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and American Academy of Pediatrics provide recommendations for preventive strategies, and recognize that infant, toddler and early childhood oral health is one of the foundations upon which preventive education and dental care must be built to enhance the opportunity for a lifetime free from preventable oral disease. Parents struggle to adopt these preventive strategies at the same time that challenging behaviors emerge in children's psychological development. This combination can make it very difficult to build the foundation of oral health practices that the AAPD recommends. There is a strong body of evidence supporting the use of behavioral parenting strategies in dealing with child behavioral problems. The proposed project introduces behavioral parent training strategies in concert with efforts to address other known parental barriers to provide an effective vehicle to promote dental health with a universal prevention intervention. This private/public collaboration between Oregon Research Behavioral Intervention Strategies, Oregon Research Institute & The Oregon Community Foundation will leverage resources and competencies to create a commercially viable coordinated oral health prevention intervention program to promote dental health targeted at parents of young children attending parenting education classes and families receiving home visiting services through Head Start. The program includes a video that can be shown in parenting education classes to engage parents on oral health and a mobile/web application to drive behavioral change. In this Phase II application, we propose refining and enhancing a coordinated oral health prevention intervention program, ""BeReady2Smile"", including video and mobile/web- application and conducting a randomized trial to assess the efficacy of the BeReady2Smile (complete program and components) compared to the current standard-of-care for pediatric dental care education. BeReady2Smile will include video content that features demonstrations/content on encouraging brushing, proper loading of toothbrush, brushing duration and frequency, fluoride myths, and limiting sugar sweetened beverages and milk in baby bottles while in bed. BeReady2Smile will also include a mobile application built within a web-based infrastructure, so parents can participate in multi-media educational activities, develop dental health behavior plans, tailor features and receive feedback from the system on a secure website. The long-term goal of BeReady2Smile is to help parents provide the foundation for a lifetime free from preventable oral disease.",R44,DE,NIDCR,DE,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,9907915,R44DE027001,R44DE027001-02A1,27001,A1,,2020,2,3037,Chris,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3970,Patient Navigator plus Remote mHealth Adherence Support with Incentives to Improve Linkage and Retention among Hospitalized Patients with Opioid and Methamphetamine Use Who Initiate Buprenorphine,"Polysubstance use involving opioids and methamphetamine is emerging as a new public health crisis. Patients with opioids and methamphetamine use often experience serious medical complications requiring hospitalization, which provides an opportunity to offer addiction treatment. Prior research demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of initiating buprenorphine among hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). Yet linkage to outpatient treatment post-discharge is suboptimal and methamphetamine exacerbates outcomes: our research showed that people with OUD who use methamphetamine have 40% lower rates of treatment linkage and are 2.4 times more likely to discharge from outpatient buprenorphine treatment programs. Building upon the prior studies, we propose to develop an intervention for hospitalized patients with OUD and methamphetamine use that combines the flexibility and human connection of patient navigation (PN) with the efficacy and scalability of mHealth-based financial incentives for linkage and medication adherence. Guided by the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model, we propose to pilot test ""MHealth Incentivized Adherence Plus Patient Navigation"" (MIAPP) to promote treatment linkage and retention for patients with OUD and methamphetamine use who initiate buprenorphine in the hospital. To our knowledge, this will be the first research to examine the benefits of a combined PN/mHealth approach to improve care transitions for hospitalized patients with opioid and methamphetamine use. Our Aim #1 is to perform a two- arm, pilot randomized clinical trial (n=40) comparing MIAPP + treatment-as-usual (TAU) versus TAU alone on outpatient MOUD linkage within 30 days (primary) and 90-day retention on medications (secondary) among hospitalized patients with OUD and methamphetamine use. Our Aim #2 is to develop health services outcome measures by performing a retrospective, observational study of hospitalized patients initiated on buprenorphine from 2019-2021 to 1) describe healthcare utilization outcomes (ED visits and hospital readmission) at 30, 90 and 180 days and 2) examine associations between baseline methamphetamine use and healthcare utilization. This pilot will provide preliminary evidence of feasibility for a subsequent R01 study to test the effectiveness of the intervention. If shown to be effective, this PN+mHealth approach could provide a transformative service model that helps reduce substantial gaps in MOUD initiation and retention for persons with opioid and methamphetamine use.",R34,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10588501,R34DA057609,R34DA057609-01,57609,,,2022,1,3065,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3973,Mhealth for Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Adherence by Young Adult MSM,"Environment and Health Group, Tufts HIV/AIDS Clinic, and the Boston-area PrEP Community of Practice will collaborate under the leadership of Patricia Weitzman, PhD, to develop and test the feasibility and short-term effectiveness of the first-ever individually-tailored, developmentally- and culturally-sensitive, mobile (mhealth) PrEP adherence tool. It will target culturally-diverse, young adult men ages 20-29 who have sex with men (YMSM). When PrEP is taken daily, it can reduce HIV risk by up to 92%. The CDC estimates PrEP is appropriate for 500,000 MSM in the U.S. Impact models show even modest PrEP adherence could reduce new HIV infections among MSM by 29% over 20 years. The recent rise in HIV infection among young adults age 20-29, particularly minority YMSM, points to the value of PrEP uptake and adherence support for culturally-diverse YMSM. In PrEP trials, younger age was the most consistent correlate with low PrEP adherence. Extensive mobile phone penetration among young adults makes mhealth an ideal, low-cost method for providing PrEP adherence support to YMSM. We bring together a developmental understanding of young adult decision making with principles from social learning theory and positive psychology for supporting PrEP adherence. The proposed project is based on Dr. Weitzman's successful Phase 1 (and current Phase 2) anti-retroviral therapy (ART) mhealth adherence intervention for HIV+ African Americans, which combined tailored pill reminders with age- and culturally-sensitive motivational and educational texts. Experts suggest building PrEP adherence interventions on proven ART adherence interventions as many PrEP adherence facilitators are the same as ART. Moreover, the growing literature on mhealth shows it is a powerful approach to supporting adherence across conditions. In addition to building on our prior ART mhealth tool, we address facilitators/barriers identified in PrEP RCT follow up studies, and CDC PrEP adherence recommendations. Moreover, formative focus groups with diverse YMSM will allow us to identify and target unique adherence barriers and facilitators in this group. The intervention will provide tailored pill reminders with PrEP education texts, as well as developmentally-sensitive motivational texts. We will include sleep hygiene and alcohol use messages, which have direct relevance to young adults. By using a low-cost, accessible mobile phone tool, the intervention eliminates several access barriers to support, which can be a particular problem for low income and minority patients. Our overarching goal is to help stop the rise in HIV among YMSM.",R43,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9347041,R43MH112221,R43MH112221-01A1,112221,A1,,2017,1,3068,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
3974,Varenicline and mobile behavioral assistance for tobacco cessation in HIV care in India.,"There is an urgent need to implement effective tobacco cessation interventions in HIV care programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where most tobacco users and people with HIV live. India is an important setting in which to test tobacco cessation interventions with an estimated 275 million tobacco users and 2 million people living with HIV (PWH). Effective medications and behavioral interventions have not been well tested in HIV care settings in LMICs. In high income settings, Positively Smoke Free (PSF), a theory- based behavioral intervention, has demonstrated efficacy among PWH and been adapted for mobile phone delivery (PSF-M). Mobile health interventions offer scalability and may be more effective among PWH than face-to-face. Varenicline is the cessation medication with the strongest evidence of efficacy in PWH but achieving sufficient adherence to sustain long-term success is a challenge. We propose to combine the two most promising cessation interventions among PWH, varenicline and PSF-M, enhanced with varenicline adherence support. They will be tested at the Voluntary Health Services (VHS) Infectious Disease Medical Center, Chennai Antiviral Research and Treatment Clinical Research Site, where 24% of patients new to HIV care are current smokers or dual users of smoked and smokeless tobacco and 83% own mobile phones. In this setting we propose the following specific aims: (1) To demonstrate the effectiveness of an integrated intervention combining varenicline plus mobile behavioral treatment among tobacco users in HIV care on biochemically verified tobacco abstinence at 24 weeks compared to a standard care control; (2): To evaluate the implementation processes of the integrated intervention in an LMIC HIV practice; and (3): To measure the costs and cost-effectiveness of an integrated intervention with varenicline and PSF-M. To accomplish these aims, PSF-M will be adapted to the VHS context and novel content about smokeless tobacco and medication adherence self-efficacy will be added. A randomized two-arm trial will compare the combination of varenicline and PSF-M to a standard care control. We will evaluate implementation processes within HIV care workflows including acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and costs and conduct cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the clinical impact and value of the integrated intervention if scaled-up. The work proposed is responsive to the specific interests in RFA-CA-20-037 by testing the effectiveness of tobacco cessation interventions with demonstrated efficacy in other settings and adapted for an LMIC context, evaluating the implementation process from multiple stakeholder perspectives in an HIV care practice, and assessing the clinical impact and value of the integrated intervention if implemented at scale. The successful completion of this work will move the field forward by advancing our understanding of the effectiveness of an integrated tobacco cessation intervention in HIV care settings and projecting the population level impacts of implementing the integrated intervention for PWH in India or other LMICs.",U01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10269132,U01CA261614,U01CA261614-01,261614,,,2021,1,3069,Chris,,,,,,,,,
3987,"mHealth Intervention via Mentors: Preventing Substance Use, Sexual Risk and Violence among Inner City Youth through Technology-Enhanced Mentoring","This K01 proposal, ""mHealth Intervention via Mentors: Preventing Substance Use, Sexual Risk, and Violence among Inner City Baltimore Youth through Technology-Enhanced Mentoring,"" addresses two fields of study relevant to adolescent health that deserve further attention, particularly in how they can intersect to improve public health: youth mentoring and mobile health (mHealth) prevention interventions. Adolescents growing up in low-income urban areas such as Baltimore are at particularly high risk for unhealthy practices such as substance use, sexual risk, and engagement in violence. For adolescents who lack socially protective resources such as parents, attentive teachers, or community networks, mentors can play a significant role in helping to reduce stress, prevent negative health behaviors, and model positive health behaviors. However, little is known about the pathways by which mentee health behavior change occurs, especially for the prevention of substance use, how matched mentors can effectively communicate health promotion messages, or how mHealth technology might be leveraged to enhance existing mentoring models. Utilizing knowledge and training gained through this award in the areas of adolescent substance use, mHealth interventions, and analysis of dyadic and ""big"" social media and smartphone data, the goal of the proposed study is to develop a prevention intervention in the form of a smartphone application (app), as well as training materials for using the app, to enhance existing mentoring models for highly vulnerable African American male adolescents in urban Baltimore. The training, professional development, and pilot data gained under this award will allow me to propose an R01 to conduct a naturalistic study or randomized controlled trial to measure effect sizes in the reduction of substance use and related health risk behaviors among mentored adolescent males. Support under a K award and the linked career development experiences will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on a new area of expertise-substance use prevention with urban American youth using mHealth-and to learn the skills required for successfully pursing NIH research funding. My long-term career goal is to answer the following research questions: 1) How can mentoring help improve health outcomes for at-risk adolescents and reduce health disparities in adulthood? and 2) How can mHealth be used in prevention intervention with this population? Fully understanding how to set up a systematic research program that intersects the fields of youth mentoring and effective mHealth intervention has great potential to lead me towards an innovative and productive independent research career in a new area. My intermediate career goals under this training grant are to focus work locally with African American adolescent males in Baltimore City, understand how technology-enhanced mentoring can serve as a universal prevention tool for urban male adolescents, build capacity to analyze dyadic data and data produced by social media and smartphone applications, and to develop collaborations with leading investigators in substance use prevention, youth mentoring, and mHealth research.",K01,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9314128,K01DA042138,K01DA042138-01A1,42138,A1,,2017,1,3083,Josh,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
3989,Optimizing an IMB-guided intervention to support HIV self-testing and PrEP uptake among YMSM: A pilot factorial RCT,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV, and more than 70% of HIV infections among youth (≤ 24 years old) occur among young MSM (YMSM). US Food and Drug Administration approved oral fluid rapid HIV self-testing (HIVST) devices provide a critical route for reducing barriers to HIV testing; however, uptake of HIVST among YMSM has been slow to date and no known studies have explored barriers and facilitators to HIVST among YMSM using rigorous mixed-methods procedures. YMSM who engage in HIVST are also good candidates for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), but PrEP uptake among YMSM has been minimal to date. The Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model is an empirically supported framework for HIV prevention, which can be applied to the barriers and facilitators related to HIVST and PrEP uptake. An IMB-guided mHealth intervention is a promising strategy to increase HIVST and PrEP uptake, offering participant confidentiality and potential scaling of an efficient intervention. Despite the promise of this type of theoretically-guided intervention, little is known about the independent effects of each IMB model construct on HIVST and PrEP uptake. To support intervention development, we will conduct mixed-methods formative research to explore IMB-related barriers and facilitators to HIVST and PrEP uptake among YMSM using data collected via online focus groups (n = 12; 96-144 individuals) with YMSM nationwide and a national survey of YMSM (n = 500; i.e., Aim 1). We will then pilot an IMB-factorial mHealth intervention to increase HIVST and post-test PrEP uptake tailored for YMSM, assessing feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact at 3-month follow-up (i.e., Aim 2). The intervention will be reviewed by an online youth advisory board and beta-tested with 12 YMSM. We will then pilot the clinical trial with 120 YMSM randomized to one of four groups using a factorial randomized experimental design, allowing us to determine which IMB model construct(s) are most important to increase HIVST and PrEP uptake. The four arms of this randomized controlled trial will be information-only (I), information + motivation (IM), information + behavioral skills (IB), and full IMB model (IMB). Dried blood spot sampling will be used to measure PrEP uptake and adherence. The training plan of this K01 award is designed to facilitate Dr. Steven A. John's transition to an independent investigator. Specifically, Dr. John will: (1) develop skills in mixed-methods research including advanced training in qualitative research methods, (2) build content expertise in mHealth interventions for HIV prevention, and (3) gain expertise in translating formative work into efficacy trials with supplemental training in quantitative analysis and implementation science. Additional training in responsible and ethical conduct in research and a focus on career enhancement and professional development will accompany the three primary training goals.

4006,"Motivation matters! RCT of theory-based, SMS to support TASP in high-risk women","Antiretroviral therapy (ART) provided to HIV-positive individuals can reduce transmission risk by 96%. In this context, identifying new strategies to optimize treatment as prevention (TasP) is a top Fiscal Year 2014 Trans- NIH Research Priority. There are important gaps in our knowledge of how to implement TasP in key populations including female sex workers (FSW). Effective TasP will require higher levels of ART adherence than those achieved in typical treatment programs. Mobile Health (mHealth) approaches employing interactive short message service (SMS) messages have shown promise as a method for improving ART adherence, leading to suppression of plasma HIV RNA. However, the ability of SMS interventions to support ART adherence in key populations like FSWs and unique clinical scenarios such as TasP has yet to be evaluated. To answer this important HIV treatment and prevention question, we will test the overarching hypothesis that in Kenyan FSWs, a theory-based, individualized, interactive SMS intervention emphasizing motivation to adhere to treatment will significantly reduce the prevalence of detectable plasma HIV RNA 6 months following ART initiation compared to standard care. Aim 1 will employ qualitative research and community participation to craft theory-based, individualized, culturally appropriate SMS messages grounded in constructs of the information-motivation-behavioral skills model. Aim 2 will compare the efficacy of the SMS intervention versus standard care for reducing the proportion of individuals with detectable plasma HIV RNA 6 months after ART initiation in a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) including 210 FSWs. Aim 3 will explore the mechanism of the intervention's effect by comparing perceptions of support and motivation to adhere to ART in intervention versus control subjects using an adaptation of the LifeWindows Information - Motivation - Behavioral Skills ART Adherence Questionnaire. An important product of this work will be a procedural manual to facilitate future research and implementation. We will also conduct a preliminary cost effectiveness analysis to enable comparison of costs and benefits in relation to other treatment and prevention interventions. Our multidisciplinary Kenyan and US team has experience conducting full-scale mHealth trials within the time frame and budget afforded by an R21. This work will provide collaborative research and training opportunities with Kenyan partners to build mHealth capacity in Mombasa County. This geographic location is defined by Kenya's National AIDS and STD Control Programme as a high-incidence cluster, making it a target area for intensive HIV prevention interventions. Successful completion of the RCT could demonstrate an efficacious strategy to support treatment and secondary HIV prevention in FSWs. Depending on the initial findings, these data will be used to inform development of funding proposals for a larger (multi-site, larger N) and longer (1-2 year follow-up) RCT, or to develop an implementation research proposal to bring the intervention to scale while further evaluating its effectiveness in a real-world implementation context.",R21,MH,NIMH,TW;MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8807554,R21MH107217,R21MH107217-01,107217,,,2015,1,3102,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
4007,"A Physical Activity Intervention to Promote Cognitive Health, Cardiovascular Health and Sleep in Older Latinos","Physical inactivity is a public health priority for older Latinos with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI, considered the pre-dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), increases the risk of developing AD and related dementias (ADRD). A recent review suggests that physical activity enhances cognition indirectly by improving health behaviors such as sleep and by reducing chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease that affect neurocognitive function. Older Latinos, the fastest growing ethnic minority group in the United States., experience a disproportionate burden of cognitive disease, including MCI, and ADRD, due in large part to higher rates of inactivity and sleep-wake disturbances that are associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk. Latinos are often identified as one of the most sedentary of the older racial/ethnic groups and experience significant multi-level barriers to physical activity - including cost, environmental/neighborhood and safety concerns [especially if ""engaging (i.e., walking) alone""], and lack of social networks. Yet, the majority of physical activity interventions have not been designed for older Latinos with MCI. Our proposed intervention study, ""Tiempo Juntos para la Salud"" (Time Together for Health) is guided by a socio-ecological framework that includes multilevel strategies: empowerment education for behavior change and individual motivation, building a social support network, and promoting cultural and community resources for safe walking. We will use a randomized controlled trial design to assess the impact of Tiempo Juntos on the primary outcome of moderate-intensity physical activity; theoretically grounded mediators; and secondary outcomes of cognitive function, CV health, and sleep at 3, 6, and 12 months among 216 Spanish language-dominant Latinos aged 55 and older with MCI [Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score ≥ 23 to 26 for Latino populations]. Participants randomized to Tiempo Juntos will receive a 1-hour, group walking intervention, designed by and tailored to older Latinos, delivered twice weekly for 3 months by a trained community health worker (CHW), and followed by bi-weekly, mobile health (mHealth) booster sessions in Months 4-6. Participants randomized to Attention Control will receive Spanish health education adapted from the National Institute on Aging online resources for older adults and including topics recommended by community focus groups in preliminary research.

4024,Aging and Health Informatics Conference,"Information and communication technologies (ICTs) affect the health and well-being of aging adults in many ways, yet older adults' adoption and use of new ICTs lag behind those of younger people. Understanding older adults' diverse needs and preferences is essential for facilitating the learning and use of eHealth/mHealth tools by older adults and their caregivers. Much effort has been devoted to the computational and engineering aspects of health informatics, much less to the social, behavioral, and cultural aspects of health informatics, particularly in relation to aging and the community. To address the intersection of current trends in aging and technology requires interdisciplinary discussion and collaboration. For this, researchers from different fields and disciplines, who by training tend to speak different vocabularies, must find common ground. Although in the health sciences the current trend in aging is well recognized and has been studied extensively, this has not been the case in informatics. Older adults are an understudied population in the design and development of new technology, including informatics tools. In addition, a common challenge for researchers is to find research sites willing to facilitate participant recruitment, data collection, and implementation of interventions. Meanwhile, community organizations are in great need of innovative interventions that may benefit their community members. The specific aims of the proposed Aging and Health Informatics Conference (AHIC) are as follows: Aim 1. To draw systematic attention to the currently understudied social, behavioral, and cultural aspects of health informatics, particularly in relation to aging and the community; Aim 2. To bring together researchers and practitioners in the health sciences and the science of informatics to discover shared interests and common ground in issues related to aging, and to build innovative interdisciplinary collaborations; and Aim 3. To serve as a forum for researchers to share their experiences with community organizations serving the older population, learn about these senior-oriented community organizations' needs and preferences, and explore innovative models of partnerships with community organizations that can benefit older adults. The highly interdisciplinary AHIC will feature participants from a wide range of academic fields and disciplines. We will also encourage participation of non-academics working with and for older adults, including those from government agencies at the federal, state, and local levels; staff and administrators of public libraries, senior centers, senior-living facilities, and other community organizations serving the older population; and members of the industry designing technology for aging users and their caregivers.

4029,Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCaTS),"/Abstract Mayo Clinic is one of the largest not-for-profit, academic health systems, top-ranked for quality more often than any other health care organization. It has integrated operations in 5 U.S. states, and more than 1 million people came to Mayo Clinic for care last year. Clinical and translational science (CTS) is a fundamental and highly valued element of Mayo Clinic; indeed, all research at Mayo Clinic is directed towards translation of scientific knowledge to improve patient care, with almost 60% of our NIH funding base classified as clinical research or trials. In recognition of the importance of continued advances in CTS to the Mayo Clinic mission, our institutional leadership has entrusted the Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CCaTS) to be the engine of translational innovation and the institutional advocate for CTS and translational research. CCaTS has served as a CTS innovation incubator for numerous efforts that were created with CCaTS funding and are now supported by the institution. The overall vision of CCaTS is to enable high-quality, team-based multidisciplinary research that accelerates clinical trial innovation, facilitates digital health transformation, and partners with our stakeholders and communities to improve patient care and health for all people. Our team- based culture has been described as one of ""boundarylessness,"" wherein organizational barriers are removed to enable talent, innovation, and knowledge to converge where needed. In this context and that of our longstanding commitment to patient-focused research, we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the following Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will simplify and accelerate the work of translation to improve health for all by advancing clinical trial innovations and digital health transformations, streamlining methods and processes, and developing novel informatics solutions that increase efficiency and drive implementation of discoveries that improve health and promote health equity. In Aim 2, we will enhance our education programs through the expanded reach of competency-based, learner-focused solutions, training a diverse, inclusive, multidisciplinary CTS workforce to be prepared to address the urgent health care needs of all communities in a rapidly changing environment. In Aim 3, we will engage local community members and patients to be active partners in translational teams, expanding research capabilities of underserved communities, including rural populations. Our goal is to improve health and reduce health inequities by helping these communities realize the benefits of CTS. In Aim 4, we will expand national and regional partnerships and strengthen collaborative CTS networks in all aspects of CTS and education, focusing on sharing innovative approaches and prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion, with the goal of improving human health and advancing health equity. In summary, sustained investment in CCaTS will enable us to continue to meet ongoing and emergent challenges in health care for all, as exemplified by our response to support communities through the COVID-19 crisis.

4032,Using Wearable Devices and Machine Learning to Forecast Preschool Tantrums and Identify Clinically Significant Variants.,"Mood and behavior problems emerging in the first few years of life often persist across later developmental stages and into adulthood, resulting in significant impairment and societal costs. However, the emerging signs of psychopathology are difficult to differentiate from normative misbehavior in early childhood, creating a ""when to worry"" problem for caregivers and providers. Specifically, the cardinal behavioral manifestation of early psychopathology, the temper tantrum (e.g., screaming, stamping, hitting), is both a transdiagnostic symptom of myriad disorders and a normative response to frustration young children commonly exhibit. It is unknown why and how clinically significant vs. normative tantrums differ due to a paucity of research capturing the complex, real-time, bio-behavioral changes occurring within both the child and caregiver, prior to and during tantrums. Research investigating the characteristics of tantrums occurring in the home environment, at multiple levels of analysis, has the potential to differentiate clinical vs. normative tantrum variants, and identify a precursor phase to tantrums that could be translated into future interventions. The Specific Aims of the proposed study are to discriminate children with and without psychopathology based on the characteristics of their tantrums, and accurately forecast future tantrums using real-time data. To accomplish these aims, the study team has developed and successfully piloted a custom smart-watch app designed to precisely denote the onset and offset of tantrums in real time and synchronize with an array of wearable and contactless devices measuring heart rate, respiration, movement, and changes in vocal features. Sixty caregiver-child dyads, 50% of whom meet criteria for a DSM 5 disorder, will be recruited. Tantrums and bio-behavioral signals will be continuously recorded in the home for one month as caregivers and children live their normal lives. Conventional statistical modeling and cutting-edge machine learning will be used to classify the presence or absence of psychopathology in children, predict the severity level of the following day's tantrums, and anticipate an individual tantrum before it occurs. This project, if successful, would produce first-of-its-kind data yielding a new understanding of the complex temporal and bio-behavioral processes underlying clinical vs. normative tantrums and algorithms designed to predict tantrums before they occur. These products are potentially highly significant as they will allow the field to pivot to developing next-generation, home-based, automated systems to assist in diagnosing and treating mental illness earlier in the lifespan.",R21,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10373392,R21MH126326,R21MH126326-01A1,126326,A1,,2022,1,3129,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
4038,Integrated Population Program for Diabetic Kidney Disease,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the US. Although many people with diabetes develop DKD, approximately one in five has DKD with uncontrolled hypertension that increases their risk of ESRD, cardiovascular events, and death. These risks are reduced by simultaneously improving control of multiple risk factors. However, prior interventions have largely: ignored low awareness of kidney disease limiting treatment; been conducted using costly face-to-face visits limiting widespread application; and included populations with limited generalizability. In addition, most studies have included those with early or late DKD but have not targeted moderate DKD and uncontrolled hypertension which would potentially optimize efficiency and impact by excluding those with stable disease and reducing the risks of ESRD, cardiovascular events and death before developing advanced DKD. For this planning grant, we propose to develop The STOP-DKD Automated Population Program (APP), a population management program that will: identify patients with moderate DKD and uncontrolled hypertension from an integrated data warehouse for a multi-state diabetes study in four underserved Southeastern counties; monitor adherence and self-management behaviors, providing e-reminders/messages to improve DKD medication adherence and health behaviors via patient-selected technology (mobile/web-based applications, text messaging, interactive voice response, or e-mail); and monitor outcomes with activation of engagement by a case manager through our existing telehealth platform for suboptimal control of blood pressure or health status. Our APP builds upon our prior work to deliver a tailored, multi-factorial intervention to address medication management and modify multiple risk factors simultaneously through a combination of patient self-monitoring, behavioral therapies and education that optimize adherence and self-efficacy. Intervention effectiveness will be evaluated among 320 individuals with moderate DKD in a six-month randomized trial to improve blood pressure control (primary outcome) and health behaviors that influence other cardiovascular risk factors (secondary outcome). To assess the feasibility of future large-scale implementation and dissemination, we will also conduct impact (using the RE-AIM framework) and economic evaluations (using the Archimedes model). For sustained adoption, this study will establish critical experience necessary for successful scale up in future effectiveness studies within this pre-identified dissemination channel and other health systems. To mitigate the growing burden of DKD in the US, this study is expected to fill a void in scalable treatment options by establishing the feasibility and efficacy of our evidence-based APP to identify and manage DKD in underserved high-risk patients.",R34,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8875677,R34DK102166,R34DK102166-02,102166,,,2015,2,3135,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,

The STEMI community will develop, evaluate the efficacy of and broadly disseminate high school learning products that address these issues. UMMC faculty in bioscience, anthropology, quantitative and qualitative data analysis, and program evaluation will guide high school science teachers from schools representative of the state's diversity of experiences and resources in new technological approaches with which to engage students in exploration of causal relationships among low health literacy, obesity, and ensuing anatomic and functional pathophysiology. STEMI will engage teachers in flipped learning/classroom (FL/C) science instruction, providing them with the tools to deliver to students' novel learning modules aligned with Next Generation Science Standards that specifically address CVD concerns directly impacted by nutrition and obesity. A UMMC anthropologist will facilitate networked approaches for creative teaching of social determinants of health, their impact on health disparities, and CVD. Summative, multisite, telecast presentations will also be created to broadly introduce school communities, peers and families to the STEMI Community of Health Learners. Four cadres of teachers will be guided through 2-year cycles of CVD-themed, didactic summer and weekend training aimed at: 1) design of FL/C explorations of obesity and health; 2) incorporation of classroom technology tools; and 3) electronic facilitation of interactive presentations on obesity, health literacy and CVD across school sites. These teachers, including 8 veterans in the first cycle and 8 early- midcareer teachers in the next 3 groups, will collaborate with UMMC graduate students in clinical anatomy (CA) to: 1) develop skills and practices that encourage entry into careers informed by biomedical sciences; 2) connect with peers and educators through projects that evaluate scientific findings; 3) learn methods for communicating public health issues; 4) gain fluency in state-of-the-art technologies; and 5) further technological collaborations that provide solutions to contemporary problems science education dilemmas.

4050,"Wearable, Always-on Stethoscope for Early Detection of Asthma Attack","This research aims to develop and test a wearable, always-on stethoscope to provide a solution to the unmet need for the quantification of respiratory symptoms. Such a device is necessary for the accurate diagnosis of asthma and assessment of asthma control in 6.8 million infants, young children and other populations with intellectual disability who are unable to report their respiratory symptoms or perform lung function testing in the United States. With accurate diagnosis and assessment of control, appropriate asthma therapy can be initiated without delays to minimize adverse asthma outcomes. The key elements needed in the proposed wearable stethoscope (i.e., a wireless stethoscope without a bulky acoustic coupler) are (1) resonant microphone array with unprecedented sound detectability over 100 - 800 Hz and (2) ultra-low power signal processing. We propose to develop a bank of acoustically-filtering microphones that are based on a high Q (quality factor) resonance of a microphone diaphragm, for accurate detection of abnormal lung sounds. A bank of Q-filtered and Q-enhanced microphones is proposed so that (1) feature-extracting filters may be avoided and (2) extremely small lung sounds can be detected from the chest without an acoustic coupler. Lung sounds are very difficult to detect from the chest without a bulky acoustic coupler, as the sound pressure level (SPL) is only 22 - 30 dB SPL, in free space, over a frequency range of 100 - 800 Hz. This kind of SPL cannot be accurately detected by a commercial miniature microphone. Thus, we will develop and use an array of 8 resonant microphones with Q of 40 - 60 (fabricated with a microfabrication process) to detect lung sounds down to 22 dB SPL, 4 dB lower than the lowest sound a human ear can detect, and to automatically segment the sound's frequency components into 8 different narrowly-band-passed frequency regions over 100 - 800 Hz. We hypothesize that continuous ambulatory monitoring of lung sounds for acoustic characteristics of asthma will improve the diagnostic accuracy and treatment in pediatric asthma patients. Currently, asthma is diagnosed in small children primarily through caregiver history and brief in-office exam as direct patient history and respiratory function testing are not available for these young patients. The proposed device is entirely novel as currently there is no device capable of providing round-the-clock monitoring for signs of asthma. While conventional microphones can detect cough and overt wheezing, their utility is limited by insufficient sensitivity, and are not amenable for continuous, ambulatory monitoring. The proposed resonant microphone array will be integrated with ultralow power electronics for a wearable stethoscope that continuously tracks lung sounds for the detection of asthma signs and symptoms such as cough and wheeze which may occur during exercise or sleep (when caregivers are not present) and may be misreported or ignored by young children. Wirelessly transmitted abnormal lung sounds will be accessed through the internet. The proposed stethoscope will provide an unprecedented means for those incapable of providing an accurate history or difficulty with self-management, such as pre-verbal children and individuals with intellectual disability, to avoid serious asthma morbidity. The device detects signs of uncontrolled asthma and notifies the parent, caregiver and medical professionals through the internet. In doing so, we may improve the management of asthma patients through more accurate tracking of environmental and behavioral triggers which can be used to improve management. To test the potential clinical utility of the wearable stethoscope, we will first record lung sounds with conventional electronic stethoscopes from pediatric patients, and annotate them as ""normal,"" ""wheeze,"" ""cough,"" etc. by a panel of expert reviewers. The annotated sounds will be subjected to spectral filtering chosen to parallel the frequency response of the proposed resonant microphone array. A pattern recognition algorithm will be applied to these sound files and be used to determine the recognition accuracy of the wearable stethoscopes. Four sets of the wearable stethoscopes will be delivered at the 18th, 30th, 42nd and 54th month of the research period, and will be used to record lung sounds and test automatic classification accuracy, which will be compared to patients diagnosed with well- or poorly-controlled asthma as determined by consensus diagnostic criteria. Finally, the wearable stethoscopes will be tested in ambulatory asthmatic pediatric patients continuously over a 30 day period, for the predictive ability of the wearable stethoscope in detecting asthma attacks.",R01,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10501924,R01HL165138,R01HL165138-01,165138,,,2022,1,3147,Chris,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,

4069,"Optimizing a Paraprofessional, Family Partner Navigation Model for Children","Two decades of evidence support the effectiveness of family navigation (FN) as a care-management approach to reducing disparities in access to health services for disorders; despite substantial promise, widespread dissemination of FN still faces significant challenges. FN is a complex, multi-component intervention that generally incorporates motivational interviewing, problem-solving strategies, patient education, and care coordination. Each of these components can be delivered through a range of strategies including in-person meetings, telehealth, home visits, and/or web-based technologies. Our team's research strongly supports FN's effectiveness as a whole; however, three questions remain: 1) what are the most effective delivery strategies for FN; 2) which FN components are the ""active ingredients;"" and 3) how can FN be disseminated to a broad population. In the current proposal, FN will be will be delivered by a Family Partner and deployed to improve access to behavioral health services among children ages 3-12 years. Our study will be carried out at a large federally qualified health center within a newly formed Accountable Care Organization. For this project, we propose to optimize FN for dissemination at scale. First, using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), which relies on a randomized, multi-factorial design, we will simultaneously test the effectiveness of three novel strategies for delivering FN components: (A) technology-assisted delivery of care coordination using an innovative, web-based platform; (B) community-based; and (C) enhanced symptom tracking using evidence-based screening instruments (compared to standard pediatric surveillance). Second, using path analysis, we will test mediators and moderators of FN outcomes. Third, using a mixed-methods approach, we will study factors that influence implementation. Integration of our three aims will yield a FN model that is optimized for efficiency, effectiveness, and wider implementation. Our specific aims are: (1) To evaluate the effectiveness of three strategies to deliver FN components. We will use a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experimental design to test three strategies to deliver FN components. Families (n=304) will be randomized to one of eight conditions. We will estimate main effects of the three experimental factors and the additive effects of combinations of factors on the study's primary outcome - engagement in appropriate mental health services. (2) To evaluate mechanisms of FN effectiveness and for whom it is most effective. (3) To Optimize FN for dissemination and evaluate implementation strategies. Following Aarons' scaling-out framework, we will use mixed methods to explore barriers and facilitators to implementation by evaluating fidelity (to intervention and implementation), reach, and cost. Then, working with our team of stakeholders, we will integrate these findings with data from Aim 1 and 2 to optimize FN based on effectiveness, identified mediators and moderators, and implementation success.",R01,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9578512,R01MH117123,R01MH117123-01,117123,,,2018,1,3166,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
4078,Improving high-risk infant care: from Hospital to Home with Neoneur Telehealth,"Abstract Neoneur 921494 Improving High-Risk Infant care, From Hospital to Home with Neoneur Telehealth (4.21) The overall outcome for high-risk infants have improved significantly over the past two decades with increased long-term survival and less major morbidities. The focus has shifted to defining outcomes according to the quality of survival, with neurodevelopmental impairments being one of the hallmarks of both prematurity and major congenital anomalies. Feeding remains a major challenge for nursing care of high-risk infants, many who start life with a feeding tube. Poor feeding is the most common reason for delayed discharge. Safe oral feeding is a particular challenge for premature infants, and those born with complex congenital disorders, many of whom are fed via a nasogastric tube initially or during recovery after surgery. Unlike other critical physiological parameters currently there is no quantitative means to measure adequate infant maturation (for the preterm infant) or recovery (for the cardiac infant) to safely transition to oral feeding without respiratory risk. The Neoneur is a hand-held, mobile device, which uniquely (issued patents 8473219, 8413502) measures patterns of oral cavity pressure, synchronized with respiration providing the clinician with a quantitative assessment of feeding patterns. In 2019, Neoneur, LLC completed over 150 clinical interviews as part of the national I-Corps program (NSF 1844816). Based on these interviews we hypothesize Neoneur's measurements are biomarkers that will improve quality of care and transitions to oral feeding, and by enabling telehealth evaluation infants will get home earlier and decreases necessity for rehospitalization due to poor weight gain. The technical effort supported by this proposal will advance the capability of the Neoneur to provide the following: utility in the clinical setting, a means for remote telehealth evaluations, demonstrated correlation to clinical relevance in infant specific measurements and tracking, improve FDA application and claims, advance market adoption, and investor readiness. This Fast-Track SBIR proposes to transform a research into a clinically relevant device through the following aims. Phase l -upgrade prototype for manufacturability, - clinical cleanliness, and telehealth functionality: Phase II - scale manufacturing, and performing a study to assess safety and clinical value/utility.

4081,Quantifying Heavy Metals in Interstitial Fluid for Remote Monitoring of Chronic Exposures,"Quantifying Heavy Metals in Interstitial Fluid for Remote Monitoring of Chronic Exposures SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic exposure to heavy metals (HM) is associated with many detrimental health effects. HM contamination in soil and water costs trillions of dollars annually to the U.S. and global economies in remediation and health costs. HM contamination particularly relevant to human health in the Western U.S. includes uranium (U), cadmium (Cd), vanadium (V), and arsenic (As). Toxicity can be attributed to individual HMs, however exposure to multiple HMs is suspected to have additive or synergistic harmful health effects. While several studies have described the surface water and sediment content of these toxic metals, determining biological loads remains challenging due to the need to collect blood or urine samples from a dispersed rural population over time. Recent advances in interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction and analysis suggest a minimally-invasive method that can be adapted to monitor HM exposure and biological loads longitudinally in both localized and dispersed communities. ISF can be collected with microneedle arrays (MA) and is a rich source of disease and exposure biomarkers. We ultimately envision a wearable microneedle patch that could be mailed to individuals or distributed through community centers. These patches would be worn for a few hours and then returned to a central laboratory to measure ISF HM levels. The central hypothesis of this project is that MA extraction of ISF will enable minimally-invasive quantitation of HM exposure, which will be a highly stable metric for exposure assessment. The Aims of the current project are to 1) Establish analytical parameters for ICP-MS analysis of HMs in MA-extracted ISF, 2) Quantify the baseline HM content of ISF vs blood and urine in unexposed populations, and 3) Characterize a mixed HM exposure model by defining the relationship between HM concentrations in ISF, blood, and urine over time. This work directly aligns with the NIEHS Mission ""to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives"" by developing minimally-invasive, longitudinal biomonitoring methods.

4091,Mentoring alcohol use intervention research in health care settings,"and Candidate. Alcohol use plays a major role in the development and exacerbation of HIV infection and comorbid mental health problems, and there is urgent need develop effective alcohol intervention strategies and train new researchers. Dr. Derek Satre, Associate Professor in the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Department of Psychiatry and Adjunct Investigator in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research (DOR) is a leading clinical psychologist studying alcohol and comorbid drug use interventions in HIV, mental health and primary care settings; and is part of an outstanding multidisciplinary team. Distinctive aspects of his research include the examination of computerized screening and intervention using electronic health records, motivational interviewing, integration in health care, and a life- span approach including older adults. Mentoring and Training Plan. Dr. Satre proposes to use K24-dedicated time to mentor USCF and DOR fellows and new scientists in patient-oriented research. His mentees will gain hands-on research experience, training in data analysis, manuscript preparation and grant writing, as well as career mentoring. Mentee training will leverage the infrastructure and resources of Dr. Satre's ongoing NIH studies and collaborations with multidisciplinary researchers in the areas of HIV, alcohol, other substance use, depression, and anxiety. To increase his mentoring skills, he proposes to participate in the UCSF Mentor Development Program and to engage in individualized training from two experienced mentoring coaches. To extend Dr. Satre's prior research experience in clinical trials, he will obtain training in use of digital health tools that can enhance patient care as well as HIV research training and mentorship. Research Plan. Building on his R01 parent study (R01DA043139), an alcohol and drug intervention study integrated into three large Kaiser HIV clinics, the proposed research will qualitatively examine patient perspectives on alcohol screening and intervention; use EHR data to examine two types of digital alcohol screening (secure messaging vs. tablet computer); and examine key 24-month clinical outcomes (HIV control, alcohol use, depression and anxiety). Summary. This K24 will leverage Dr. Satre's active research program with extensive infrastructure at UCSF and DOR to support a program of (1) expanded mentoring in alcohol treatment research, (2) career development via mentorship courses and coaching, and digital health training, and HIV care, and (3) research to advance the goal of implementing effective interventions to reduce alcohol consumption and alcohol-related health problems.",K24,AA,NIAAA,AA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9452771,K24AA025703,K24AA025703-01A1,25703,A1,,2018,1,3188,Tom,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
4098,Sensing Technologies for maternal depression treatment in low resource settings (StandStrong),"There is a high global burden of untreated postpartum depression. Untreated postpartum depression presents acute and long-term risks to a mother's mental and physical health, as well as her child's survival, health, and development. Although there is increasing willingness among funders and health systems to involve non- specialists, such as community health workers, in the delivery of psychological interventions for postpartum depression, the outcomes of these non-specialist interventions have been mixed. Digital technology, specifically the use of passive sensing data collection to learn more about a mother's life and support behavior change, has the potential to improve the effectiveness of psychological interventions delivered by non-specialists. For the proposed R21/R33, we will build on preliminary development work of Sensing Technologies for Maternal Depression Treatment in Low Resource Settings (StandStrong) to demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and functionality for postpartum depression treatment in Nepal. StandStrong is a digital platform consisting of two mobile apps, internet-of-things (IoT) passive sensors, and a data analysis engine built using modern machine learning approaches. StandStrong incorporates passive sensing data collection from mothers and their infants that can be monitored by non-specialist counselors and then incorporated to better personalize psychological treatment. For Aim 1 (R21 phase), we will use human-centered design to iteratively refine the StandStrong platform and associated implementation material. For Aim 2 (R21 phase), we will evaluate the StandStrong platform and associated contents according to acceptability, feasibility, usage, benefit, and validity. If milestones are met for the R21, we will proceed to the R33 stage, in which we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a psychological treatment as usual with the psychological treatment supplemented by the StandStrong passive sensing platform with 112 depressed mothers (56 in each arm). For Aim 3 (R33 phase), we will identify parameters for sustainability and scalability through engagement of policy, healthcare, and telecom stakeholders, as well as costing the intervention and building mHealth research capacity. Successful completion contributes to the NIMH's 2020 Strategic Plan to tailor existing interventions and develop innovative service deliver for diverse populations. This project will contribute to NIMH's Opportunities and Challenges of Developing Information Technologies through improving treatment of mental illness through use of passive sensing technologies.",R21,MH,NIMH,TW;MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10268579,R21MH126877,R21MH126877-01,126877,,,2021,1,3195,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
4101,iRise: Willingness of Low-and Middle-Income Country-based Health Workers to Respond to Public Health Emergencies and Disasters - an mHealth Intervention Study,"Healthcare workers' (HCWs') willingness to report to work in pandemics and other public health emergencies and disasters is a foundational prerequisite for national, regional and global health security amidst an ever- broadening array of natural and manmade emergent threats. Well-documented case reports and research point to significant and concerning gaps in response willingness toward public health emergencies and disasters, including among low- and middle- income country (LMIC)-based HCWs. Further, research to date in LMIC and other settings has highlighted HCWs' self-efficacy as leading predictor of their willingness to respond (WTR) during such crises. Higher levels of self-efficacy positively influence motivation, willingness to respond and take action, and to persevere when challenges are encountered, including exhibiting teamwork, expressing sensitivity, managing politics and handling pressure. Prior studies by membership of the research team have been accompanied by training interventions that yielded significant increases in self-efficacy, and attendant WTR, among frontline HCWs. However, this training was designed to be in-person and several hours long, which presents a difficult logistical challenge for busy Emergency Department HCWs. Could mobile health (mHealth) technology offer an efficient approach to training and support to enhance self-efficacy and increase WTR among LMIC-based HCWs? To the very best of our knowledge, there has never been a mHealth product or intervention to address self-efficacy and WTR. Accordingly, this gap presents an opportunity to generate a novel mHealth application to enhance frontline LMIC-based healthcare workers' self-efficacy and WTR during public health emergencies and disasters. By extension, such a mHealth intervention could strengthen staffing surge capacity in resource-challenged health systems in LMICs, and thus shore up critical gaps in health security. The study's purpose is first to assess the feasibility of strengthening self-efficacy and response willingness toward public health emergencies, including pandemics, and disasters in emergency department clinical personnel in a LMIC setting (R21); and, if feasible, carry out a trial to confirm the effectiveness of the approach on outcomes (R33) [see below] in Karachi, Pakistan. Our R21-component specific aims (SA) are: SA1: Characterize and measure LMIC-based emergency medicine healthcare workers' (HCWs') baseline self- efficacy toward fulfillment of work-related roles and expectations in pandemics and other public health emergencies and disasters, and their attendant perceptions regarding willingness to respond in such contexts. SA2: Develop and pilot-test a novel mHealth intervention (iRise [""intervention (for) response in significant emergencies""]) among a group of LMIC-based emergency department HCWs to determine its acceptability, reliability, and perceived usefulness in a culturally sensitive and appropriate manner for busy emergency department HCWs in LMIC settings. SA3: Develop local LMIC-based partners' mHealth research capacity and prepare for an effectiveness trial. Under this aim we would focus on strengthening mHealth-based research capacity among health professionals to support conducting trials, digital data collection, and disaster preparedness in Pakistan. If found feasible, the following are our R33 specific aims: SA4: Gauge short-term (1-month), medium-term (6-months), and longer-term (1-year), impacts of this novel iRise mHealth app on LMIC-based HCWs' self-efficacy and willingness to respond during public health emergencies and disasters. SA 5: Further refine the mHealth app to enhance its attitudinal and related impacts on LMIC-based HCWs' self-efficacy and response willingness in public health emergencies and disasters.",R21,TW,FIC,TW,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10268584,R21TW012210,R21TW012210-01,12210,,,2021,1,3198,Tom,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
4111,Social Convoy Palliative Care (Convoy-Pal) Mobile Health for Older Adults with Advanced Heart Failure,"This is a submission for the NIA K76 Paul B. Beeson Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging. Dr. Jennifer Dickman Portz's long-term career plan is to become a leader in developing and implementing digitally-supported palliative care that can be used by older adults with advanced illnesses and their ""social convoy"" (i.e. family members, informal and formal caregivers) to effectively improve patient-family centered health outcomes. Her proposed research will refine and test the Social Convoy Palliative Care (Convoy-Pal) mobile application, a new intervention that integrates the social convoy in digitally-supported palliative care to promote symptom management and quality of life among older adults with advanced heart failure. Candidate: Dr. Portz is currently a T32 Aging and Palliative Care Research Fellow in the School of Medicine at the University of Colorado, and an Assistant Professor of social work at Colorado State University and the Colorado School of Public Health. Training: The proposed K76 career development plan is designed to develop Dr. Portz's expertise in digital health for geriatric palliative care with 1) training in clinical palliative care, digital usability testing, mixed methods, pragmatic clinical trials, and leadership skills, and 2) hands-on research experience in mobile health development. Dr. Portz proposes ongoing mentorship, coursework, and research leadership experience. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Portz and her primary mentor, Dr. Sheana Bull, assembled an interdisciplinary team with expertise in digital health, heart failure, geriatrics, computer science, and palliative care who will mentor Dr. Portz through the proposed training and research activities. To augment this team, an advisory commitee of nationally recognized experts in palliative care, aging and technology, and social work will monitor Dr. Portz's career development progress. With support from Colorado State University and the University of Colorado, Dr. Portz is well-positioned to lead geriatric palliative care research efforts across Colorado. Research: As older adults with advanced illness increasingly rely on the support of others to help manage their health, there is a critical need to foster approaches for effective integration of the social convoy in mobile health. Thus, the objective of this award is to use heart failure specific palliative care as a model to investigate the design, usability, and feasibility of digitally supported palliative care by older users and their social convoy. Dr. Portz will work with her mentors to develop, refine, and test the Convoy-Pal. Summary: Dr. Portz proposes a patient-family centered approach to the design and evaluation of the first convoy-focused heart failure palliative care specific mobile application. She has an established interdisciplinary mentorship team to ensure the completion of the proposed research and complimentary training. The Beeson Award will enable Dr. Portz to strategically develop her leadership skills to become an innovator and change agent in digital health and social work research for geriatric palliative care. !",K76,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9588755,K76AG059934,K76AG059934-01,59934,,,2018,1,3208,Audie,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
4112,Developing wearable OPM-MEG to assess brain function in mother-infant dyads during social interactions,"The proposed work will adapt current wearable, optically pumped magnetometer-based magnetoencephalography (opmMEG) for use in infants, and will then further adapt these protocols for simultaneous recording of brain activity in mother-infant dyads during naturalistic social interactions. While both electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been used to assess brain function in infants, and EEG has even been used to simultaneously assess mother-infant dyad brain function during naturalistic interactions, they each have limitations that are addressed by wearable opmMEG. Both EEG and fMRI allow for high temporal, millisecond, resolution; however, EEG poses challenges for source localization. Although fMRI addresses the source localization issues of EEG, it does not allow for the same naturalistic social paradigms as EEG, and is also loud and expensive. OpmMEG is non-invasive, quiet, and provides both high temporal resolution and accurate source localization. OPMs can be used at room temperature, unlike other MEG sensors that must be cooled using expensive cryogens. OPMs are also small and lightweight, making them amenable to use in wearable helmets, which can be used even during paradigms that include participant motion. All of these characteristics of opmMEG make it an ideal candidate for adaptation for use in infants, and further, use in naturally interacting mother-infant dyads. The ability to assess brain function simultaneously within a mother-infant dyad represents an unprecedented opportunity to gain knowledge about typical development, which is key to being able to recognize clinically relevant patterns of brain function indicative of later emerging psychopathology. Once the proposed work is completed, we will have developed optimized protocols, and the first-ever opmMEG data collected in an infant, as well as the first ever simultaneous mother-infant opmMEG collected during naturalistic, physically-touching, social interactions. The innovations represented by this proposal are paramount to moving the field of infant imaging vertically to improve our understanding of neurodevelopment using salient social interactions that exist within the developmentally unique and formative mother-infant dyad.",R21,EB,NIBIB,EB,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10373318,R21EB031547,R21EB031547-01A1,31547,A1,,2022,1,3209,Audie,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
4123,Mississippi Center for Clinical and Translational Research,"Mississippi has some of the nation's worst health outcomes and was ranked by the United Health Foundation as the ""least healthy state"" in 2019. Further, the racial disparities surrounding these health outcomes are profound. The complexities associated with effectively addressing Mississippians' health outcomes and ameliorating Mississippi's health disparities necessitate a strong, multi-disciplinary research and outreach infrastructure. The Mississippi Center for Clinical and Translational Research (MCCTR) was established in 2016 to provide this infrastructure, equipping researchers with the resources needed to conduct clinical, translational, and population-based research projects. The MCCTR proposes to continue and expand its efforts through what it has termed as ""Phase II."" In Phase II, the MCCTR will add two new institutional partners, Mississippi State University and University of Mississippi-Oxford, to its Phase I partners, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Tougaloo College, and University of Southern Mississippi. It will also add two CTR/CTSAs as collaborating partners, the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Center for Clinical and Translational Science and the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences, to its Phase I partners: Mayo Clinic's Center for Clinical and Translational Science and the Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science Center. The Administrative Core will be responsible for managing the administrative, fiscal, and scientific aspects of the MCCTR, including the oversight, marketing, and coordination of all MCCTR cores and activities. The Professional Development Core will offer structured mentorship, training opportunities, and protected research time for early stage investigators at MCCTR partner institutions. The Community Engagement and Outreach Core will provide training and support to investigators in conducting community engaged research; partner with healthcare providers through its new Practice-Based Research Network; and work with its expanded Community Advisory Board to provide bi-directional communication and guidance on community values, concerns, and needs and represent the MCCTR to Mississippi Communities. The Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design Core will provide training and assistance with research design, data collection and management, and statistical analysis to increase the effectiveness, efficiency, and success of research conducted by MCCTR investigators. The Pilot Projects Program will support clinical, translational, and population-based research projects likely to have a meaningful impact on Mississippi health outcomes and lead to extramural funding. The Research Services Core will support research projects through study coordination and regulatory support and will help connect researchers to communities through expanded telehealth and cohort-study resources.

4136,Home Telemedicine to Optimize Health Outcomes in High-Risk Youth with Type 1 Diabetes,"The severity of T1D complications warrants an urgent need to improve glycemic control since 22% and 17% of children and adolescents with T1D, respectively, have suboptimal A1C >9.5%. Moreover, the T1D Exchange recently showed that an average A1C of 9% in 13-17 year olds is not much lower than the A1C average of 9.5% seen in the same age group at the beginning of the DCCT over 30 years ago. In fact, youth ages 2-17 years have an average A1C of 8.6%. In addition, there is an alarmingly high rate of pediatric DKA in the United States, with 7% of youth <18 years of age hospitalized for DKA. NIDDK recognizes that diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious acute complication, in youth must be addressed and strategies to reduce it developed, including significantly reducing time spent in hyperglycemia. Suboptimal adherence to critical T1D management behaviors (e.g., blood glucose monitoring, insulin dosing), either alone or in combination with psychosocial stressors, may lead to suboptimal glycemic control. Indeed, individuals with T1D and mental health comorbidities are 2x as likely to be in suboptimal glycemic control, yet 30% of T1D care teams do not have access to onsite mental health services. Moreover, mental health comorbidities are associated with worsening long-term complications. One possible pathway to improving glycemic control is to increase access via home telehealth This study is novel as it will use home telehealth intervention to address suboptimal T1D management and glycemic control by integrating medical and behavioral health (i.e., psychological) interventions to reduce negative and costly physical health outcomes in high-risk youth with T1D. The primary objective of this study is to address the critical need of providing intervention to high-risk (A1C=9-12%) youth with T1D. If achieved, T1D care practices will change by providing high-risk youth with T1D and their parents medical and behavioral health support via home telehealth intervention, which has the potential to significantly change access to T1D care, decrease time spent in hyperglycemia, reduce the frequency of hospital admissions, and improve glycemic control. In addition, use of Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), a highly efficient experimental strategy to determine effective intervention components, should be generalizable to all individuals with T1D, leading to cost-effective, home telehealth intervention programs. Innovative aspects include: 1) assessment of physical and behavioral health characteristics associated with high-risk status; 2) delivery of home telehealth that incorporates: 2a) medical and behavioral health care delivered with the endocrinologist and behavioral health specialist working together with high-risk youth; 2b) personalized intervention to improve T1D adherence and T1D clinical health outcomes; 2c) personalized intervention to improve mental health comorbidities and T1D clinical health outcomes; and 3) an underused methodological approach for optimizing intervention components to be delivered at point of care.",DP3,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9302223,DP3DK113363,DP3DK113363-01,113363,,,2017,1,3233,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
4140,Optimizing Technology Uptake and Use in Hard to Reach Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes,"Young adolescents (ages 10-15) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at high risk for deterioration of glycemic control and relatedly poor overall T1D self-management. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) provide real-time indicators of glucose levels and alert users to hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Consistent, informed use of CGM has the potential to improve glycemic control and related T1D health outcomes. However, adolescents with T1D are the least likely age group to utilize CGM and significant health disparities exist in access to and use of CGM among youth from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds and youth with public insurance. Adolescent CGM users also continue to evidence A1c levels above recommended targets, potentially due challenges related to perceived CGM burden and related family functioning. Novel, developmentally targeted interventions delivered early in adolescence could promote optimal uptake and use of CGM and reduce psychosocial barriers to sustained use but must be evaluated in rigorous pilot trials that attend to health disparities. The current study proposes to evaluate an innovative behavioral intervention that utilizes certified diabetes care and education specialists (CDCES) to teach problem-solving and communication skills around CGM data and use, targeting adolescent-parent T1D interactions related to glucose data, individualized CGM challenges, and weekly adolescent-parent joint review of CGM reports. The intervention also addresses HCP knowledge of health disparities in diabetes technology through interactive education, and boosts family support through connection with peer parent consultants. This study aims to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the behavioral intervention to enhance CGM use and resulting T1D health outcomes. Sixty adolescents and their parents will be recruited for this pilot randomized trial, randomly assigned to either an immediate intervention group or a delayed intervention group serving as a standard care comparison. Intervention content will be delivered via 3 telemedicine sessions with adolescents and a parent and supported by connection with a peer parent consultant. Medical and psychosocial data (including A1c, CGM indicators, CGM burdens and benefits, diabetes distress, and diabetes-related family conflict) will be collected from adolescents and a parent at baseline and three follow-up time points across the first year after CGM initiation. We will employ quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate intervention feasibility, acceptability, and impact. Enhancing CGM access and use at this key developmental juncture provides an excellent opportunity for tailored support and problem- solving, resulting in potentially lasting improvement in diabetes self-management. Results of this pilot trial will directly inform a multi-site randomized clinical trial to evaluate efficacy, with the long term goal of identifying effective behavioral strategies that can be integrated into routine diabetes education and care.",R01,DK,NIDDK,DK,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10340417,R01DK131026,R01DK131026-01,131026,,,2022,1,3237,Josh,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
4155,Addressing Disparities in Healthcare Access and Outcomes among Chronically Ill Older Adults: Assessing the Feasibility of an Agent-Based Modeling Approach,"Prior research shows persistently greater burden of illness and poorer access to care among racial minorities and low-income individuals; older adults with chronic illness are no exception. Although evidence on the social determinants of health has grown, many questions remain about the complex interplay of individual, organizational, and environmental factors in health disparities generally, and in healthcare access and outcomes in particular. This developmental study will assess the feasibility of using a state-of-the-art systems science method - Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) - to examine and address the complex array of factors contributing to racial and socio-economic disparities in healthcare access and outcomes among chronically ill older adults. We will capitalize on an existing dataset that includes three years of health care claims on a cohort of 278,820 New York City-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 and older with diabetes, heart failure and/or hypertension linked with data on neighborhood characteristics (e.g. supply of primary care and federally qualified health centers, neighborhood walkability, and transit access). Applying ABMS to the existing data could establish the groundwork for developing a decision-support tool to guide interventions in health disparities; however, it is essential to first identify the most influential factors in each level of analysis and how they interact. Focusing on the three levels of analysis needed to build a prototype agent-based model, the specific aims are to assess the feasibility of: (1) developing an individual-level agent model with the available data on demographics (e.g. race, age, low income), diagnoses, patterns of outpatient healthcare use and outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, emergency department visits); (2) modeling the organization of health services across the care continuum by combining data on sequencing and intensity of service delivery and health care supply; and (3) developing a neighborhood-level model that includes socio-demographic composition, walkability, public transit, safety, amenities and social services as environmental determinants of healthcare access and outcomes. This study will determine whether agent-based modeling is feasible for capturing the multiple dimensions of phenomena that influence healthcare access and outcomes among vulnerable populations. This work would lay a foundation for a larger study that includes simulation of promising interventions using an expanded dataset that could include both Medicare and Medicaid claims for services delivered since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a model that serves as a decision support tool to guide policy and practice interventions at the provider and/or community level to improve the health of underserved populations of older adults with chronic illness and, in turn, reduce health disparities.",R21,AG,NIA,OD;AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9243577,R21AG053542,R21AG053542-01A1,53542,A1,,2017,1,3252,Chris,,,,,,,,,
4174,Mechanisms of mindfulness for smoking cessation: optimizing quantity and quality,"Mechanisms of mindfulness for smoking cessation: optimizing quantity and quality. Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the U.S., costing more than $193 billion in health care costs and lost productivity annually. There is a growing body of evidence that mindfulness training (MT) is effective for addictions, including alcohol and nicotine use disorders. Early results suggest that on a psychological level, MT may target the link between craving and smoking. In other words, mindfulness may help individuals ""ride out"" cravings instead of getting caught up in them - without smoking. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the efficacy of MT for addictions are unknown. We have developed a mobile app-based MT program for smoking cessation, which has shown preliminary efficacy in smoking cessation (Craving to Quit, C2Q). Mobile trainings such as this are ideal for providing standardized delivery of treatment, which helps minimize variability when studying underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Given their electronic platforms, these tools can also be more easily monitored for adherence and adapted for refinement. We have also developed a real-time EEG neurofeedback device that can provide source-estimated feedback from specific brain regions. This is now being tested in clinical trails to examine if it can augment mindfulness acquisition in individuals who are taking Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). However, this technology has not been tested in clinical populations or for specific conditions or disorders. Bringing all of these elements together, we now have an opportunity to (1) determine the mechanism of mindfulness in cue-induced smoking; (2) test strategies to enhance engagement in mobile MT; and (3) determine if neurofeedback can strengthen identified mechanisms of MT. In the proposed study, Aim 1 will determine if mindfulness training alters neural correlates of cue reactivity in smokers. To achieve this, smokers will be randomized to receive MT (C2Q) vs. an active control (experience sampling). Cue-induced PCC activity will be measured pre- and post- training. Aims 2 and 3 will optimize treatment engagement and quality of mindfulness skills. This proposed phased research approach will be the first to uncover the neurobiological mechanisms of mindfulness for smoking (and potentially addiction more broadly). It will utilize these results to refine both quantity and quality of mobile MT while providing preliminary evidence that the modulated mechanisms of mindfulness are associated with clinical benefits, including smoking cessation.",R61,AT,NCCIH,OD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9206563,R61AT009337,R61AT009337-01,9337,,,2016,1,3273,Audie,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
4193,Olera - Online Platform to Increase Access to Personalized Educational and Professional Assistance for AD/ADRD Caregivers,"There are currently about 5.8 million older adults living with Alzheimer's dementia, and the numbers are only expected to grow in the coming decades. The majority of care for persons living with dementia (PLWD) is provided by family members who lack formal training in caregiving and thus need education, information, and assistance. While an array of technology solutions for caregiving has been suggested to meet these needs, the adoption rate has been low, potentially due to poor usability (e.g., difficult to use) and lack of contextual relevancy. The long-term objective of this proposed research is to develop a technology-based solution that integrates web and mobile platforms to link dementia caregivers with personalized information and resources that are easily accessible by populations across the socioeconomic spectrum. The proposed study will focus on information and educational materials on financial management and legal planning. Such information will be helpful for caregivers experiencing difficulties due to their immediate caregiving responsibilities, as well as those transitioning in their roles and responsibilities as the PLWD's health condition progresses. This collaborative project, involving industrial, academic, and community partners, is oriented around two specific aims: (Phase 1 Specific Aim 1) Development of the digital platform based on a novel Dementia Care Personalization Algorithm and initial feasibility assessment. Framed around an interactive Design Thinking product design methodology, phase 1 consists of the iterative process: Build, Measure, and Learn. A pilot group of 25 dementia caregivers will be recruited to serve as a user feedback panel. Our milestone for moving to Phase 2 will be assurance of the feasibility of the digital platform assessed using metrics from the adapted Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) and Technology Adoption Model (TAM). (Phase 2 Specific Aim 2) Evaluation of the acceptance of the developed digital platform across racial/ethnic populations. Phase 2 is a prospective usability study to evaluate the acceptance of the proposed digital platform across three different racial/ethnic populations of dementia caregivers in Texas (N = 300; n = 100 African Americans, n = 100 Hispanic/Latinx, and n = 100 non-Hispanic Whites). The prospective feature of the study design will enable the enrolled participants to explore and use the developed digital platform for about 4 weeks to provide multiple assessments of the perceived usefulness, ease of use, and value. At the completion of the two specific aims, we expect to have developed a widely accessible digital platform tailored to assist dementia caregivers in navigating through financial and legal challenges by linking caregivers to personalized and contextually relevant information and resources in the Texas area. If successful, the proposed commercialization plan anticipates further deployment of the developed digital platform by working with professional caregiving organizations to scale and sustain the platform to meet the needs of the growing population of dementia caregivers.",R44,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10302989,R44AG074116,R44AG074116-01,74116,,,2021,1,3292,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
4203,"Structural Racism and Discrimination in the Expansion of Hospital Stroke Care Capacity: A Multi-Level Analysis on Access to Care, Treatment, and Outcomes","/Abstract Structural Racism and Discrimination in the Expansion of Hospital Stroke Care Capacity Although advances in the treatment of stroke have significantly decreased morbidity and mortality for stroke patients in the United States, there is a growing disparity in the provision of stroke services between disadvantaged populations and others. No studies have examined the role of structural racism and discrimination (SRD) in the expansion of stroke care capacity across communities and subsequent effects on health disparity patients. The long-term goal of this project is to identify system-level pathways in the delivery of acute stroke care that contribute to the growing disparities for NIH-designated health disparity populations (defined as racial/ethnic minority, low-income, and rural patients). The overall objective is to determine the mechanisms through which health disparity patients experience SRD in stroke care. Using national data from 2009 to 2019, we propose three aims to test the following hypotheses: Aim 1, That disadvantaged communities (defined as segregated areas with high shares of health disparity populations) experience differential adoption of levels of stroke care, resulting in increased disparities in potential access to care relative to other communities. Aim 2, That health disparity patients in segregated communities experience increased disparities in actual access and treatment due to patient redistribution across hospitals with different levels of stroke care and differential treatment within hospitals. Aim 3, That individuals in disadvantaged communities and health disparity patients experience widening disparities in health and functional outcomes. In Aim 1, we will identify which types of disadvantaged communities, if any, were left behind in gaining stroke care access, and whether racial or ethnic segregation and income inequality contribute to these structural disparities in geographic access. These results will aid certification bodies to consider incorporating community need in certification guidelines. In Aim 2, our results will illuminate patient redistribution patterns in communities that gain access to stroke care and pinpoint patients who experience disparities in actual access and treatment depending on their race, ethnicity, and income as well as the level of segregation in each of those dimensions. Results will identify the types of communities where outreach might be most effective in reducing disparities in stroke care. In Aim 3, our results will determine the extent of health disparities among stroke patients a) between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged communities after adoption of stroke care, compared to communities with no change; and b) between health disparity and other patients within the same community when those communities experience changes in stroke care, relative to those in communities with no change in access to stroke care. These findings will identify specific communities where additional interventions (e.g., mobile stroke units, enhancing telehealth access) could yield the greatest benefits.",R01,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10473300,R01MD017482,R01MD017482-01,17482,,,2022,1,3302,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
4205,Mobile medical application for cost-effective strabismus screening,"In this project we propose to complete development and performance evaluation of a smartphone-based mobile medical application (EyeTurn) for use by eye-care professionals and lay people to screen for strabismus (eye misalignment). Strabismus develops in an estimated 3-8% of the U.S. population and is a leading risk factor for amblyopia in young children. Early detection and treatment are critical to prevention of permanent vision losses, yet only 40% of U.S. children under age 6 reportedly receive vision screening. In the elderly and in head trauma populations where the prevalence is highest, untreated strabismus can result in postural instability, leading to a significantly greater risk of devastating falls. However, significant barriers of cost and availability of trained examiners limit access to strabismus screening for at-risk populations, especially in under-served rural and low-income areas and elder care facilities. The novel EyeTurn app provides the first image-based tool for eye alignment testing by lay persons without reliance on a costly device. We propose to further develop the EyeTurn app to improve reliability of automatic eye detection and vertical strabismus measurement, add HIPAA-compliant patient data management, improve the operator interface for cover- uncover testing and for screening/home use, and incorporate modules for user training, patient education, and doctor finding. We will evaluate EyeTurn performance relative to standard test methodology in targeted populations likely to contain subjects who are difficult to accurately measure, including both young children and head trauma or low vision patients. We will also report initial estimates of EyeTurn sensitivity and specificity in a pilot-scale application to pediatric screening. At the conclusion of the Phase II project, we will have demonstrated accuracy, reliability and effective range comparable to or exceeding costly tests now employed in strabismus screening. Bringing this low cost product to wide commercial availability, we could make possible a paradigm shift in cost-benefit calculations for strabismus screening and measurement globally, resulting in greater access to treatment for strabismus-affected individuals. A demonstrated effectiveness for use by vision care professionals will position EyeTurn to apply for FDA pre-market approval and perform clinical trials in support of use by lay people for strabismus screening.",R44,EY,NEI,EY,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,9347937,R44EY025902,R44EY025902-02,25902,,,2017,2,3304,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
4236,Mobile Phone Intervention to Prevent Youth Suicide in Rural Communities,"Reducing youth suicide has been named as a national priority for more than a decade, yet rates of youth suicide and suicide attempts have not declined. Suicide is still the 3rd leading cause of death for ages 10 - 24, and suicide rates i rural communities are more than double the national average. The public health impact of commonly applied strategies, such as gatekeeper training, is limited by minimal communication between adolescents and adults, minimal help seeking by adolescents, and by problems with accessibility and acceptability of mental health services. These barriers are particularly relevant in rural and underserved communities, which have 2-10 times higher youth suicide rates and lower utilization of available services. School-based, population oriented strategies overcome some of these limitations, but existing programs have yet to harness mobile communication devices to reach adolescents with preventive interventions directly, even beyond the school context. Text messaging is low-cost, effective tool for changing health behaviors, and is emerging as a powerful public health tool for influencing adolescent risk behavior. My application would be the first extension of mobile devices into population-based suicide prevention. The K23 career development award will provide me with the education and experience I need to become an independent investigator focused on developing and testing mobile-mediated public health interventions to reduce youth suicide. This proposal has three career development goals: Goal 1. Intervention Development. Learn the principles and practices needed to develop a safe, engaging, and effective mobile-mediated mental health intervention to target suicide risk and protective processes for youth. Goal 2. Prevention Trial Design. Gain expertise and collaborators to select and sequence prevention trial designs and research methods that are suitable for testing flexible electronically-delivered interventions for youth. Gol 3. mHealth Knowledge. Gain scientific and technical knowledge to collaborate effectively with technical experts and to assess opportunities for mHealth technologies in youth suicide prevention. I developed a research project that provides a framework for meeting these career development goals. My research objective is to develop and test the effects of a suicide preventive intervention delivered to adolescents via mobile technology. To achieve this objective my project has three aims: Aim 1. Development. Develop a safe and engaging text messaging intervention (Text4Strength) to strengthen adolescent's emotion self-regulation skills and resources. Aim 2. Field Testing. Assess the usage, usability, participant perceptions, and system operation of Text4Strength by conducting a field test of with 43 adolescents, and revise the intervention as needed. Aim 3. Pilot RCT. Assess the promise of Text4Strength. Assess the impact of Text4Strength on key proximate targets examining: skills in monitoring emotions, reducing escalation, and using adult relational resources to maintain emotional equilibrium. Secondarily, I will explore the intervention's impact on psychological distress, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and suicide ideation. The career development plan anchored by this research project will give me the skills, experiences, collaborators, and technical infrastructure that I need to be a leading expert in applying mobile technology to prevent youth suicide in rural communities. By putting an option-rich intervention in the hands of youth in rural communities, the proposed research addresses NIMH priorities: Strategic Objective 3 to improve and personalize mental health interventions; Strategy 4.1 to test novel models and methods to bring mental health interventions to diverse groups, including rural communities.",K23,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,5,No,Awarded,8890235,K23MH101449,K23MH101449-03,101449,,,2015,3,3336,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,

We propose an accessible and accurate smartphone-based screening tool that (i) sends a soft acoustic chirp into the ear canal using the smartphone speaker, (ii) detects reflected sound from the eardrum using the smartphone microphone, and (iii) employs a machine learning model to classify these reflections and predict middle ear fluid status in realtime. Given the ubiquity of smartphones and the inaccuracy of visual otoscopy, the system we propose has the potential to be the default screening tool used in developing countries by healthcare providers and caregivers at home.",R43,DC,NIDCD,DC,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9906782,R43DC018434,R43DC018434-01,18434,,,2019,1,3345,Josh,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
4250,Optimization of a mHealth Physical Activity Promotion Intervention with Mindful Awareness for Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivors,"There are approximately 680,000 adolescent and young adult cancer survivors (AYACS) in the U.S., and the survival rate in this group is increasing. AYACS experience a myriad of deleterious treatment-related side effects, higher rates of physical and emotional problems and are at a heighted risk of early morbidity and mortality compared to non-cancer age-matched controls. Increased moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) is consistently associated with enhanced quality of life (QOL), reduced cancer treatment- related side effects and chronic disease risk, and improved cancer prognosis in cancer survivors. Yet, the majority of AYACS (~60%) do not meet cancer-specific MVPA recommendations (i.e., 150 mins/week), and very little research on MVPA in cancers survivors has focused specifically on AYACS. Existing studies of MVPA in survivors are largely resource-intensive, costly, and deliver multiple components (i.e., coaching calls, supervised exercise) simultaneously limiting scalability. Three evidence-based strategies have been identified that may be particularly useful for overcoming these barriers and increasing MVPA in AYACS: 1) electronic delivery of a MVPA program, 2) social support, and 3) mindfulness training. However, little is known on the unique roles of social support and mindfulness in MVPA promotion. More granular information about the discrete effects of these components is needed to optimize intervention configuration in order to maximize an effective and scalable MVPA program for AYACS. The purpose of this study is to apply the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), to determine which types of social support and mindfulness training intervention components optimally increase MVPA in a 12-week mHealth MVPA intervention with a 12 week follow-up. MOST is a framework adapted from engineering that uses highly efficient factorial experiments to evaluate individual, and combined, effects of intervention components to determine which ones can be reduced, eliminated or replaced to improve efficiency. Inactive AYACS (n=304) will receive a core intervention consisting of the OPTIMAL AYAO app and Fitbit and be randomly assigned to 4 components under consideration for inclusion in the optimized intervention: 1) general mindfulness training; 2) MVPA specific mindfulness training; 3) e-coach and 4) engagement of a buddy. We will also examine the effects of increasing MVPA on symptom burden, intensities of other activities (i.e. light and sedentary), and sleep quality and duration and potential mediators and moderators of component effects. The proposed study represents the first systematic effort to use MOST to design an optimized, scalable mHealth MVPA intervention for AYACS. This study will lead to an improved understanding of how to effectively change AYACS' MVPA and ultimately, improve health and disease outcomes in this population.",R01,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10278744,R01CA262357,R01CA262357-01,262357,,,2021,1,3350,Chris,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
4265,A telehealth tDCS approach to decrease cannabis use: Towards reducing multiple sclerosis disability in multiple sclerosis,"Cannabis is used by up to half of the U.S. >1 million people living with the neurologic condition of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common chronic and progressive CNS disease to affect adults of working age. Growing evidence shows that cannabis use actually worsens MS disability for many, and specifically contributes to the commonly (>75%) disabling feature of cognitive impairment. However, for the many patients seeking to reduce or discontinue their use, there are few if any accessible interventions available, leaving both clinicians and investigators to only counsel for its discontinuation. To meet this critical need, our expert team connects our extensive work in the use of noninvasive brain stimulation in MS to its established applications in the treatment of substance use disorders. Although the neural circuitry contributing to this cycle of addiction is well known, there are no neural circuit based therapeutics available for cannabis use disorder (CUD) treatment. We propose a novel and readily scalable approach that is highly accessible due to its telehealth delivery that allows all study procedures to be completed form home. Our innovative approach will use repeated sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as a target of negative affect that is identified as a key component in perpetuating disordered substance use. A core feature of Koob & Volkow's 3-stage model of addiction, negative affect both results from disordered use and drives continued use. We therefore hypothesize that reducing distress in this context will lead to reduced cannabis use. We overcome a major limitation in the clinical evaluation of tDCS to date with our remote protocol, enabling access to treatment and providing extended treatments for adequate evaluation of its cumulative benefits. We will recruit a readily available sample of patients with MS and CUD, to evaluate 20 daily (M-F) sessions over one month, using RS-tDCS as a tool to decrease distress (Aim 1) and reduce cannabis use (Aim 2). As tDCS is ideally paired with a concurrent activity to increase benefit and to maintain consistent ""brain state"" to evaluate its effects, stimulation will be paired with guided mindfulness meditation. In the context of this evaluation, we will collect cognitive and symptomatic measures towards our ultimate objective of evaluating its effects on disease burden. We will collect follow-up outcomes at one-, two- and three-months post-intervention. Public Health Significance: We will pioneer our RS-tDCS telehealth intervention for individuals seeking to discontinue cannabis, evaluated in people living with MS and applicable across the many patients with chronic brain disorders for whom cannabis may contribute to their disability. With the COVID-19 pandemic driving unprecedented rates of substance use disorders, the need for scalable, remote therapeutics that can be coupled with telehealth behavioral techniques is even more critical.",R21,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10389675,R21DA055427,R21DA055427-01,55427,,,2022,1,3365,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
4267,"Rock Steady- A mobile, gamified vestibular rehabilitation therapy app for older adults with complaints of dizziness","The long term objective of this SBIR application is to develop and test a minimum viable product (MVP) of Rock Steady, a software application for adults with vestibular dysfunction. This product is relevant to the mission of the NIDCD because it addresses the request for, ""the development of technologies for the study, diagnosis, and treatment of balance disorders, particularly for the elderly"". The envisioned product is an elegantly simple mobile application that is designed to measure adherence to a home exercise program of gaze stability exercises based on recommendations from the 2016 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Vestibular Rehabilitation. This product was conceived in response to four main drivers: 1) the growing number of adults aging with balance impairments due to vestibular dysfunction, 2) the finding that vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) improves quality of life, 3) the need for developing engaging exercise programs that will improve adherence to VRT, and 4) a lack of commercially available low cost tools to support VRT. This application is very timely given the growth in the number of older adults and the ease of dissemination via smart tablets/PCs which are being adopted by older adults at faster rates than ever before. By deploying the app on common digital technology we will ensure its widespread adoption. Finally, it will be designed with end user feedback from all stakeholder groups including people with vestibular dysfunction. Broad Objective: We intend to translate existing evidence-based educational material, assessments and gaze stability exercises to a mobile device for widespread dissemination and adoption to increase adherence with home and clinic based VRT, promote health and wellbeing and improve patient care and outcomes through coordinated higher quality of care. Approach: In Phase 1 we will 1) employ user-centered design methodologies to develop and evaluate reliability, validity and usability of Rock Steady 1.0 for adults with vestibular dysfunction, over age 60, 2) integrate eye/head tracking and 3) identify and evaluate feature and content expansions/adaptations for Rock Steady 2.0. In Phase 2 we will employ user-centered, iterative design approaches to develop Rock Steady 2.0 and further feasibility, usability, and a pilot effectiveness study. Research Design: We will use a randomized trial design to evaluate reliability, validity and usability. All participants will complete two versions of standard evaluations of vestibular dysfunction using traditional paper/pencil method and via the app. Participants will be randomized to begin with either the app or traditional approaches. Reliability will be compared using interclass correlation coefficient, validity will be evaluated using Pearson/Spearman statistics and usability will be evaluated using the System Usability Scale questionnaire. Expected Outcomes: We believe that Rock Steady will be a valid and reliable adjunct to VRT. The app will provide healthcare professionals with important data regarding adherence, and function while also reducing the cost of care delivery.",R43,DC,NIDCD,DC,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9344950,R43DC016245,R43DC016245-01,16245,,,2017,1,3367,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,

4274,HYBRID TYPE 1 EFFECTIVENESS-IMPLEMENTATION TRIAL FOR PRIMARY CARE DEPRESSION SCREENING AND REFERRAL TO A REMOTE DIGITAL MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC,"The global burden of depression is staggering: Affecting an estimated 7 to 10% of the adult U.S. population in any given year, depression's high rates of comorbid conditions and association with impaired functioning and disability costs the U.S. approximately $200 billion per year. Issues continue to plague screening, recognition, and treatment for depression in primary care settings. Patients with depression are recognized as such, less than half of the time in the U.S, with 49.2% sensitivity and 81.1% specificity for accurately identifying patients having a current major depressive episode. Treatment for depression usually begins with primary care providers prescribing antidepressants and use of collaborative care models, however, patients experience many barriers to these treatments such as high costs, embarrassment in seeking help, and long waits for appointments. These treatments have also been shown to have only a short-term effect, and patients continue seeking treatment without finding an accessible and effective solution to alleviate their depressive symptoms. Meru Health Medical, P.A. developed a complete and clinically proven treatment program for depression, anxiety, and burnout with long-lasting outcomes. The Meru Health Program (MHP) is a 12-week, mobile app- based online digital mental health clinic overseen by a licensed clinical therapist and a psychiatrist. The delivery of the MHP seeks to overcome many of the barriers that can hinder the receipt of mental health services such as improved access and less stigma. This SBIR Direct-to-Phase II application is aimed to conduct a multi-site Hybrid Type 1 Randomized Control Trial (RCT) of the MHP among adults who screen positive for depression in primary care to prepare for the program's rapid dissemination. This application proposes a proof-of-concept study to develop and optimize the study materials, test the screening, referral, and study enrollment procedures in preparation for a 300-patient multisite RCT. Following, a multistakeholder process evaluation of the delivery of the MHP intervention will be conducted to guide the set-up of subsequent studies and to better understand contextual factors for implementation. The study design allows simultaneous testing of the effectiveness of the clinical intervention on relevant outcomes while observing and gathering information on implementation which is requisite for the program's rapid dissemination. The unique benefit of the MHP is in its discreet administration to patients with the treatment modalities and approaches utilized in the program, validated by high quality studies showing significant proof of efficiency. Meru Health Medical, P.A. is committed to cutting-edge research conducted with integrity as a way to continuously improve the MHP. This application will establish the feasibility of referral to the MHP via direct screening in a primary care setting, benefiting the high percentage of U.S. adults turning to primary care healthcare professionals who seek a long-lasting treatment method for depression.",R44,MH,NIMH,MH,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10375031,R44MH126836,R44MH126836-01A1,126836,A1,,2022,1,3374,Audie,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
4286,Mobile Phone Intervention for Physical Activity Maintenance in African American Men (MobileMen),"African American men experience health disparities across a number of preventable chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, strokes, obesity, and diabetes. Physical activity (PA) is a modifiable risk factor for these conditions. The few PA promotion studies that have included African American men have resulted in successful short-term behavior change, yet in order for the health benefits of PA to be realized, PA levels must be maintained. While behavior change maintenance programs have been shown to assist participants in sustaining behavior change, we were unable to identify any studies that have developed maintenance programs specifically targeting African American men. The purpose of this proposal is to develop a PA maintenance program for African American men. This Phase I STTR project, MobileMen, will deliver the intervention utilizing mHealth technology and therefore, will be led by researchers and multimedia developers at Klein Buendel, Inc. (KB) and Pennington Biomedical Research Center (Dr. Newton, PI). The use of mHealth, as opposed to other avenues of intervention delivery, is based on published reports documenting that African Americans perceive mobile technology as an acceptable means of intervention delivery. In addition, ownership of smartphones and the use of text messaging are highest among African Americans compared to other ethnic groups. There is a need to tailor this intervention towards African American men because they have unique gender role beliefs which influence exercise promotion. There is also increasing recognition of the need for researchers to develop interventions in collaboration with the target population. Therefore, the current proposal will involve conducting formative research with African American men to identify the key elements for program development. The fact that mHealth is acceptable to- and the fact that the application will be developed in collaboration with African American men, leads us to hypothesize that African American men will view the mHealth intervention as acceptable, feasible, and usable. In this Phase I STTR, we will: (1) conduct multi-method formative research to guide app design and content, (2) produce a functioning app prototype, and (3) conduct usability testing on the prototype for functionality, ease of use, and interest among African American men. To our knowledge, no study has utilized mobile phones as a means of effecting PA levels in African American men.

4287,Can mental health apps work in the real world? A feasibility pilot study,"Over two million people in the US download health apps onto their smartphones and tablets, with the intent of improving their quality of life. Despit widespread use of these apps, there is relatively little information regarding app user access (do users download health apps and use them more than once), app user engagement (do users follow the app protocols) and app impact on mood, cognition and daily functioning. Our long-term goal is to conduct a future randomized controlled trial investigating access, engagement and impact of two types of mental health apps, apps based on evidence-based therapeutic principles (i.e.: Problem Solving Therapy) and apps based on cognitive neuroscience principles of depression (i.e.: a cognitive training game called Evolution) and compare both to an information only app. Our intent is to conduct this study entirely on mobile devices, in order to investigate access, engagement, and impact in an ecologically valid manner. The purpose of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of conducting our future randomized controlled trial comparing three mobile mental health apps for the management of depressed mood, improvement of cognitive control, and improvement in activities of daily living in people aged 18 and older. Recruitment, consent, randomization, app use and outcome assessment will be conducted entirely on mobile devices. We will recruit 150 people through four different recruitment avenues to determine which avenue results in the most representative sample of our target population (people 18 and older who have symptoms of depression that are interfering with their quality of life). We will also determine the number we need to recruit to have a final sample of 150 people willing to be randomized between the 3 apps and complete an 12-week study of app impact on mood, cognition and function. This pilot will provide information on the completeness of data from a study conducted in this manner, and uncover any other challenges we may face by using mobile devices for data collection, and if we will find differential drop out between app type (e.g.: will more people stop using of the information only app prematurely?).

4302,Development of a handheld PEST-pen device for the rapid detection of organophosphate insecticides on food and clothing,"The neurotoxicity of organophosphate (OP) insecticides in humans may result from dermal or inhalation exposure on clothing and machinery or orally from the residue on food. In the latter context, the health consequences associated with the use of OP insecticides, especially in children, could be reduced by monitoring produce and eliminating the consumption of OP- contaminated food. PlantVax currently employs the Nicotiana benthamiana (N.b.) plant expression system to produce high levels of recombinant human acetylcholinesterase (rHuAChE) which is used in devices e.g. the FLIR CAD-pen, for the detection of trace amounts of OP nerve agents for military purposes. In this proposal, PlantVax aims to develop for food safety purposes, a simplified, hand-held, portable, self-contained and inexpensive PEST-pen to rapidly detect phosphorothionate insecticides on food, clothing and machinery. However unlike active OP nerve agents, OP insecticides exhibit a wide range of bimolecular rate constants (ki) ranging from ki = 101M-1min-1 to 109M-1min-1) against esterases e.g AChE. These fall into two categories (i) those with high ki (>104M-1min-1) which contain an ""oxon-like"" bond and can be used immediately to produce a functional PEST-pen in Phase II and (ii) those with low ki (~101-3M-1min-1) which have a P=S bond and will need to be converted by oxidative desulfuration into the active oxon form by cytochrome P450 and NADPH for their toxicity and detection. The new PEST-pen device will utilize the same esterase-based embedded chemistry as the CAD-pen with a yellow to red color change as a read-out, but with two important modifications required to increase the ki and thus the color change (i) the use of recombinant human CES (rHuCES) also produced in N.b. plants immobilized into the pen sponge as the target enzyme since Phase I results indicated a 10-fold to 1,000-fold increase in ki against both thion and oxon forms with this enzyme and (ii) the integration of P450 and NADPH into the pen to convert kilow to kihigh to enable the detection of many highly toxic OP insecticides which might have otherwise gone undetected. In Phase II, the chemistry will be optimized in twenty functional printed pens and then two thousand beta- prototype PEST-pens, which are compatible with the chemistry, will be designed and produced by injection molding for testing in the field. It is planned to initially test vegetable and fruit samples in markets and farms in the USA, Asia and Central America to demonstrate the utility of the PEST- pen globally.",R44,ES,NIEHS,ES,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,2,No,Awarded,10079784,R44ES029405,R44ES029405-02A1,29405,A1,,2020,2,3402,Pablo,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,

This consortium reflects seven applications: NCANDA - Administrative Resource (UCSD) and NCANDA - Data Analysis Resource (SRI), and five cross-national Research Project Sites, located at Duke University (Duke), Oregon Health Science University (OHSU), University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), SRI International (SRI), and UC San Diego (UCSD). Monitoring has involved annually multimodal neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, resting state fMRI, task fMRI), cognitive, clinical, behavioral, and biological data, collected in person or remotely by computer and our mobile app. These measures will now be complemented with new advanced neuroimaging and sleep and physical activity tracking. Our accelerated longitudinal design uniquely positions NCANDA-A (ages 18-34) to quantify transient or enduring alcohol-related disturbances in adolescent and early adult neural system growth trajectories and functional concomitants. NCANDA-A proposes four consortium-wide specific aims and two specialty project aims. In Aim 1, we investigate the impact of excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence and emerging adulthood on subsequent developmental trajectories of cognitive performance, brain structure and function, and psychopathology. Aim 2 identifies the extent to which alcohol's effects on brain structure and function resolve or persist during desistance of binge drinking. Aim 3 identifies adolescent biological, environmental, and behavioral factors that forecast excessive drinking during early adulthood. Aim 4 quantifies COVID-19 pandemic impact on alcohol use, stress, and wellbeing. Aim 5 (SRI and Pittsburgh sites) identifies interactions among alcohol use, sleep, and cardiac function. Aim 6 (UCSD, Duke and OHSU sites) determines the extent to which short-term (i.e., 4 weeks) alcohol use discontinuation results in acute improvement in cognition, affect, sleep and resting heart rate, and reversal of structural and functional brain effects of binge alcohol use. For each aim, sex differences will be tested.

4306,Improved Accuracy of NIRS-based Skeletal Muscle Oxygen Saturation Measurement through Model Creation and Advanced Signal Processing Techniques,"Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) oximeters have the potential to measure tissue oxygenation in brain, muscle, and other organs to improve management of blood transfusion, shock, hypoxia-ischemia, and vascular disease. However, currently available NIRS tissue oximeters have either been calibrated primarily for cerebral oxygenation measurements or for other tissues at a limited depth, limiting accuracy or applicability to these clinical conditions. The aim of this proposal is to develop LED-based NIRS tissue oximetry sensors capable of measuring skeletal muscle oxygenation several centimeters deep to the surface. The sensor design will decrease inter-subject variability of the measurement and improve accuracy of the measurement. This depth of measurement will allow for application to monitor peripheral artery disease, shock detection, and blood cell transfusion. Key milestones include: • Determine optical light characteristics of skeletal muscle tissue which impact accuracy of NIRS tissue oximetry through a vascular occlusion study • Determine if an improved ex vivo blood-tissue model utilizing lipid mixing techniques can adequately represent blood tissue optical characteristics • Determine effectiveness of dynamic path-length adjustment signal processing to reduce inter-subject variability and improve skeletal muscle tissue oximetry accuracy Ex vivo models allow for known and controllable reference values, but fail to model the appropriate tissue scattering properties. Severed limb models have been tested, but also do not necessarily represent the scattering properties of living human tissue measured by NIRS. Human vascular occlusion models allow for appropriate light scattering properties to be assessed, but fail to have controlled or known reference saturations. A combined approach of an improved ex vivo model and a vascular occlusion study with advanced signal processing techniques will be incorporated, altering the ex vivo modeling to better represent optical characteristics of tissue. The end result will be a robust model of skeletal muscle tissue and a tissue oximetry sensor with improved accuracy for skeletal muscle measurement and reduced inter-subject variability. Phase II work will focus on expanding into lower limb occlusion studies and validation in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients to document characterization of the optical properties of skeletal muscle in the presence of plaque and possible light path adjustment techniques for correcting alterations in optics.

4307,Financial incentive strategies for weight loss in obese patients living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods,"Financial incentives for motivating changes in health behavior, for weight loss in obese individuals, are increasingly being tested by health insurers, employers, and government agencies. However, a key unanswered question regarding weight loss is how to structure these incentive programs to maximize their (1) effectiveness, underscored by the fact that most programs have not resulted in significant long-term weight loss; and (2) economic sustainability, as defined by their return on investment-a major factor in public and private decision-making. Obese patients represent an important population to target for effective weight loss interventions because they suffer from a high prevalence of serious obesity-related illnesses-including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart disease, stroke, sleep apnea, and cancer-disproportionately have a low socioeconomic status, and impose $147 billion in costs on the healthcare system annually. While prior studies testing financial incentives in this population have had variable short-term success and few have yielded long-term weight loss, a fundamental question remains unanswered and may partially explain variability in weight loss outcomes: specifically, it is unknown whether goal-directed incentives (incentives for achieving evidence-based, intermediate goals that increase weight loss but are underutilized, like dietary counseling, physical activity, behavioral self monitoring, and intensive weight management programs) or outcome-based incentives (like incentives for successfully losing weight) are more effective for promoting weight loss. Prior studies of weight loss incentives have largely emphasized only the latter. We propose a three-arm randomized controlled trial that will address this important knowledge gap among obese patients living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, with implications for other serious chronic health conditions. Comparing goal-directed incentives to outcome-based incentives and usual care, we will assess their impact on weight loss (≥5% of baseline weight), use of evidenced-based therapy, and quality of life, and evaluate their short-term and long-term return on investment.",R01,MD,NIMHD,MD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9216745,R01MD011544,R01MD011544-01,11544,,,2016,1,3407,Tom,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
4312,Mobile WACh Empower: Mobile solutions to empower reproductive life planning for women living with HIV,"Meeting reproductive health needs of women living with HIV (WLWH) is essential to help women prevent unintended pregnancies, safely conceive, and eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT). Reproductive life planning is complex for WLWH, who are faced with making decisions about antiretroviral treatment selections and potential for drug interactions with contraceptive methods, planning for safe conception, and STI prevention. While family planning (FP) use is high among WLWH, discontinuation of FP is common among women who desire pregnancy prevention, and is an important driver of unmet need for FP and subsequent risk of unintended pregnancy and adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Many programs in sub-Saharan Africa integrate FP service delivery into routine HIV care, but HIV care providers face challenges with implementing these models of care. HIV care providers may be ill equipped to ensure WLWH receive high-quality, rights' based reproductive health counseling and services due to lack time, training, resources, and skills. Prior studies on integrating FP services into HIV care consistently cite implementation challenges. Mobile health technology may provide a low cost solution to augment counseling services, strengthen health care systems, and alleviate demands on HIV providers. We hypothesize that providing comprehensive counseling and two-way SMS communication, will 1) improve delivery of integrated HIV and reproductive health care services, 2) reduce contraceptive discontinuation rates, 3) be acceptable and feasible to implement, and 4) be cost-effective and contribute to prevention MTCT efforts. We will adapt a unique two-way SMS platform (Mobile WACh) that combines automated bulk SMS messaging and dialogue with a health care provider for a new population, new environment, and new outcomes for long-term impact. The Mobile WACh platform will be customized to provide continuous reproductive life planning counseling for WLWH. We will test the combined intervention in a cluster randomized controlled trial among women receiving HIV care at 10 facilities in Kenya (330 per facility). We propose to evaluate the effect of the counseling and SMS communication intervention, Mobile WACh Empower, on reproductive health outcomes. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of the Mobile WACh Empower intervention on FP discontinuation, dual method use, and unmet need for FP over 2 years. In Aim 2, we will evaluate acceptability, feasibility, and scalability of implementing Mobile WACh Empower under real- world settings, from both WLWH and provider perspectives in focus group discussions. In Aim 3, we will construct a mathematical model to measure health and economic impacts of Mobile WACh Empower, including cost- effectiveness of the intervention per pregnancy and MTCT averted. This trial will evaluate a novel intervention to address a crucial gap in provision of integrated reproductive health and HIV care, and has the potential to make a significant contribution to global goals of universal access to FP and elimination of MTCT.",R01,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10254868,R01HD104551,R01HD104551-01A1,104551,A1,,2021,1,3412,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
4317,Mouthpiece for mTBI Detection during Adolescent Contact and Collision Sports,"There is a need for new inexpensive tools to discover potential concussive events or mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) on the playing field. As we discover more about the long term effects of concussions, sub- concussive blows, and the importance of rest following a concussive event, the need for tools to identify concussions is becoming an increasing public concern. Many of these nominally ""mild"" injuries lead to poor neurological outcomes that adversely affect an individual's quality of life - i.e. second impact syndrome, post concussion syndrome, and long lasting neurocognitive deficits such as learning disabilities, memory problems, and emotional or behavioral changes. Despite increasing public awareness of this issue, TBIs are difficult to identify as athletes commonly hide the signs and symptoms, only 10% of cases result in loss of consciousness, and other mTBI signs and symptoms may only last for fifteen minutes or fewer. Recognition of TBI's during sports activities is very important because individuals with TBI's are much more vulnerable, given further impacts, to more severe brain injury until they are healed. Additionally, while recent research indicates that younger athletes are more likely to sustain an mTBI and are more vulnerable to long term effects, there is little actual data linking clinical outcomes with biomechanical assessment for pre-teens and adolescents. Since there is currently no helmet or safety gear that is protective against concussion during athletics, many resources are being put into concussion education and risk management. Risk management is currently centered on the macro scale with strict return to play guidelines and league rules or state laws that prohibit full contact practices more than three times a week for example. The proposed solution uses a unique design to provide a mouthpiece with better accuracy and/or lower cost than currently available commercial products that can be used in all sports. The solution will provide a sideline alert of a potential concussion for further clinical evaluation and head impact dosimetry. The research team assembled for this project includes a commercialization partner with current custom mouthpiece products and deep industry ties, a successful engineering team, and a research group that has performed previous mouthpiece impact sensor studies.",R44,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9407260,R44HD090763,R44HD090763-01A1,90763,A1,,2017,1,3417,Pablo,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
4322,Health Aging & Later-Life Outcomes Planning (HALLO-P),"The Health, Aging and Later-Life Outcomes Planning Grant (HALLO-P) is submitted in response to RFA-AG-21-016. Collectively, HALLO-P affiliated investigators have led 17 clinical trials of caloric restriction (CR; 3 ongoing), enrolling 2,773 adults (ages 55-91) with BMIs ≥ 27 kg/m2, showing multiple beneficial physiologic changes associated with lower disease and disability risk. Whether this translates to actual reductions in disease and disability is unclear. A large multi-year trial with definitive clinical outcomes is needed to fill this evidence gap. Time restricted feeding (TRF) could be an attractive alternative to CR if it produced similar health benefits, was more easily sustained, and mitigated CR's undesirable loss of muscle and bone. The overall goal of this 3-year HALLO planning grant is to develop a protocol for a rigorous, multi-site, randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing clinically-relevant health outcomes in older persons randomized to daily CR, a TRF regimen, or a non-dietary attention control group employing innovative mHealth tools to promote adherence. We will complete a 12-month pilot study enrolling 120 older adults (age ≥60 years; 50% women; ≥23% minority) to provide critical information on feasibility, intervention delivery, and data informing effect size determination. HALLO-P's Objectives are to: 1. Establish a scientific advisory board and other structures to guide planning activities and the design of a full- scale RCT that engage a wide range of stakeholders and build a national constituency for the project. 2. Refine our mHealth behavior-change and adherence tracking platform-the HALLO-P Companion App-to optimize delivery of both the CR and TRF interventions. 3. Conduct focus groups and a 12-month pilot RCT of: 1) 20% CR delivered in-person; 2) 20% CR delivered remotely via video conferencing; and 3) TRF (8-10 hours) with ad libitum caloric intake. Pilot data will help refine recruitment criteria, estimate recruitment yields, and refine intervention approaches. We will use doubly- labeled water to measure achieved CR and continuous glucose monitoring to assess adherence to TRF. 4. Model aging biomarker changes for differing CR doses using WF OAIC repositories and the HALLO-P pilot. Existing epidemiological databases will be used to estimate the anticipated effect of these biomarker changes on clinical outcomes and to derive key design metrics related to inclusion/exclusion criteria, and event rates related to multi-morbidity, health deficit accumulation, and functional decline/disability; and 5.

4331,mHealth for Heart Failure: Predictive Models of Readmission Risk and Self-care Using Consumer Activity Trackers,"Heart failure (HF) is a debilitating disease that affects over five million people in the United States. Occurrence of, morbidity related to, and hospitalization due to HF have serious financial implications. In 2009, HF had a direct cost of over $34 billion annually, the majority of which was due to hospitalizations. By 2030, HF total direct costs are predicted to reach $53 billion, and indirect costs are predicted to rise from $31 billion to $70 billion. Increases in costs are contingent on the increase in the aging population, making prevention of HF and care efficiency imperative. Fifty percent of readmissions due to HF are preventable, with lack of adherence to prescribed self-care as the driving factor. Results of telemedicine intervention studies to support adherence to self-care and improve HF outcomes are inconclusive. Past telemedicine interventions for HF have utilized an array of methods including: wireless sensors, telephone services, websites, and home visits from nurses. Structured telephone support has shown in some cases to reduce hospitalization, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce all-cause mortality in HF patients. However, patient adherence to telemedicine interventions is often low. This lack of adherence is due in part to the high treatment burden placed upon patients in such home monitoring interventions, which require them to engage in novel behaviors, including using new unfamiliar hardware and spending time meeting with home health nurses. The goal of this R01 is to demonstrate the following: 1) patients are more adherent with a home monitoring regimen when using minimally-invasive monitoring technologies, including wrist-worn consumer activity trackers; 2) a minimally-invasive home monitoring regimen combined with novel predictive algorithms may be used to forecast hospital readmission; and 3) data from the electronic health record (EHR) and a baseline survey may be used to predict levels of adherence to the home monitoring regimen. Towards these goals, we will recruit 500 HF patients to participate in a minimally-invasive home monitoring regimen. A novel mobile application will allow patients to monitor their progress, submit additional data, and receive adherence notifications. We will measure levels of adherence to the regimen, and use collected sensor data and known readmission events to create a novel hidden semi-Markov model that continuously predicts readmission risk. Predicting a patient's level of adherence will be performed with EHR data and a baseline survey using several techniques, including logistic regression and support vector machine models. The work outlined in this proposal will produce a set of foundational tools for performing home monitoring of HF patients. These tools will be adaptable for future studies of individually-tailored interventions, towards our ultimate goal of allowing patients to download an ""app"" from an ""app store"" that adapts to their individual characteristics and allows them to more effectively manage their disease.",R56,HL,NHLBI,HL,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9544373,R56HL135425,R56HL135425-01A1,135425,A1,,2017,1,3432,Tom,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
4340,Decision Making and HIV Risk: New Approaches to neuroAIDS Research in Drug Users,"﻿ DESCRIPTION: Individuals addicted to illicit stimulants like cocaine play an important role in the continued transmission of HIV due to high rates of sexual risk behavior and, among those already infected, poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy. The field of neuroAIDS has provided convincing evidence that persons with HIV infection and/or drug addiction are more likely to experience deficits in decision making that are potentially relevant to HIV risk behavior. However, case-control designs and laboratory-based measures of decision making have been limited in predicting HIV risk behaviors in the ""real world."" The goal of this Avenir Award is to advance our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms through which drug addiction and HIV infection impact decision- making processes relevant to HIV risk behavior. Specifically, this proposal addresses the following limitations of the field: (1) modeling addiction as a static condition rather than a chronic, relapsing disorder, with studies utilizing strict eligibility that minimize generalizability to the population and analyses that do not adequately account for variability and fluctuations in drug use; (2) cognitive assessments in controlled laboratory settings intended to optimize performance; and (3) reliance on convenience sampling for a hard-to-reach population. The proposed Avenir project will: use respondent driven sampling to engage a heterogeneous cohort of cocaine users, both HIV-positive and HIV-negative, from the community; conduct trimonthly laboratory-based assessments of neurobehavioral functioning over 1 year to capture natural fluctuations in drug use, decision making, and HIV risk behavior; and use mobile health (mHealth) technology to assess cognitive functioning and risk behaviors in real-time in natural settings. During an initial period of formative work, including focus group with the target population, we will adapt three widely used decision making tasks and develop an app for mobile devices. We will then screen and enroll 200 participants into the neuroAIDS cohort. Between the 3- and 6- month follow-ups, cohort participants will use a smartphone to record daily drug use and HIV risk behavior and complete ecological momentary assessments of decision making, drug state (e.g., craving, intoxication) and context (e.g., setting, social situation). This Avenir project builds logically from my previous research on decision making and HIV risk, integrating multi-disciplinary techniques to advance our understanding of HIV-related decision making in drug users.

4349,Reducing Provider Workload While Preserving Patient Safety: A 2-Way Texting Intervention in Zimbabwe's Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision Program,"Because male circumcision (MC) reduces the risk of female-to-male HIV-1 transmission by up to 60%, nearly 10.4 million voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) procedures were performed in sub- Saharan Africa where the HIV epidemic is most concentrated. VMMC is safe: the average rate of moderate and severe adverse events (AEs) at the country level is 0.8%, corresponding to 99% of men healing without incident. To reach the global target of 20 million by 2018, VMMC productivity needs to double in countries already plagued by severe healthcare worker shortages like Zimbabwe. The ZAZIC consortium partners with the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) and performed over 120,000 VMMCs. Current VMMC care in Zimbabwe requires in-person, follow-up visits at post-operative days 2,7, and 42. Over 95% adhere to multiple follow-up visits within 14 days of VMMC. ZAZIC's program has an overall AE rate of 0.4%; therefore, overstretched clinic staff conducted more than 200,000 unnecessary reviews for VMMC clients without complications. High mobile phone ownership, severe healthcare worker shortages, and rapid VMMC scale up make ZAZIC's VMMC program an ideal setting to test a mobile health (mHealth) intervention to reduce provider workload while safeguarding patient safety. Through an un-blinded, prospective, randomized, control trial (RCT) in high-volume facilities providing VMMC, ZAZIC will implement an interactive, two-way texting (2wT) intervention to identify men healing without complication, allowing them to decline routine in-person follow up visits. 2wT will simultaneously identify men with any sign of an adverse event, encouraging rapid in-person follow-up when an AE is suspected on any day, reducing unnecessary visits while maintaining quality care. We aim to 1) determine if 2wT can safely reduce VMMC follow-up visits; 2) estimate the cost savings associated with 2wT over routine VMMC follow-up; and 3) assess the acceptability and feasibility of 2wT for further scale-up. It is expected that this intervention with be as safe as routine care while providing distinct advantages in terms of efficiency, costs, and reduced healthcare worker burden. This approach is innovative as it focuses on using a low-cost mHealth intervention to reduce provider workload without deterioration in quality care. The success of this intervention could lead to adoption of this intervention at the national level, increasing efficiency of VMMC scale up and reducing burdens on providers and patients. ZAZIC's international, interdisciplinary team will build the capacity among local research colleagues and MoHCC collaborators, helping the Zimbabwean team become future leaders in mHealth research.",R21,TW,FIC,TW,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9341021,R21TW010583,R21TW010583-01,10583,,,2017,1,3450,Audie,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
4353,"Evaluation of Trauma Center-Based, Technology-Enhanced Stepped Care Intervention for Adolescent Traumatic Injury Survivors","Pediatric traumatic injury (i.e., injury of sudden onset and severity requiring immediate attention) is the leading cause of death and morbidity among US adolescents and are associated with mental health and health risk outcomes. Pediatric traumatic injuries are associated with medical and societal costs of $87 billion and elevates risk for a wide range of health risk consequences that affect quality of life, physical recovery, social functioning, and return to previous activities. The prevalence of PTSD and depression is high among pediatric traumatic injury patients; however, most pediatric trauma centers don't have the resources to implement models of care that address mental health following injury. Current guidelines by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Committee on Trauma strongly recommend screening and addressing emotional recovery in traumatic injury patients. The ACS Committee on Trauma has identified this as a priority and likely will begin to mandate mental health programs in Level I and II pediatric trauma centers nationally. It is therefore critical that policy and practice is guided by the implementation and evaluation of scalable and sustainable models of care. In 2015 our team launched the Trauma Resilience and Recovery Program (TRRP), a scalable and sustainable, technology-enhanced, multidisciplinary stepped model of care - one of the few in the US - that provides early intervention and direct services to improve access to evidence-based mental health care after traumatic injury for children, adults and families. We have found this model of care to be feasible and acceptable to adolescent patients (ages 12-17) at each level of service. TRRP includes 3 major steps: (1) in-hospital education, brief risk reduction session, and tracking patients' emotional recovery via an automated text-messaging system, (2) conducting a 30-day screen via telephone to identify patients who are good candidates for psychological treatment, and (3) providing referral to best-practice telehealth-based or in-person assessment and treatment. We have partnered with three accredited Level I and II pediatric trauma centers and propose a multi-site hybrid 1 effectiveness-implementation trial with 300 adolescent (ages 12-17) traumatic injury patients to: 1) assess the extent to which TRRP promotes improvement in quality of life and emotional recovery and 2) gather preliminary data on the potential for TRRP to be implemented in other Level I trauma centers. Directly in line with NICHD's Pediatric Trauma and Critical Illness Research and Training (PTCIB) Strategic Research and Training agenda, this study will provide valuable data on the efficacy, preliminary effectiveness and potential for implementation of an innovative, cost-effective, sustainable technology-enhanced intervention designed to address the unique needs of adolescent injury patients and mitigate short- and long-term impact of injury on mental health, quality of life, and overall well-being.",R01,HD,NICHD,HD,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10295320,R01HD102336,R01HD102336-01A1,102336,A1,,2021,1,3455,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
4363,Establishing an fNIRS Ecosystem for Open Software-Hardware Dissemination,"Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive brain imaging and monitoring modality that measures the changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations associated with brain activity. Over the past 20 years, there has been exponential growth in the number of publications utilizing fNIRS, demonstrating that the modality can measure cortical brain responses to varied stimuli relevant for investigations of both normal and pathological brain function and development, as well as for clinical applications. To facilitate and accelerate fNIRS adoption and impact, there is a great need for easy-to-use analysis software that can help standardize the analysis, presentation, and comparison and mining of results from across multiple labs, just as SPM did in the early days of fMRI. While there is currently limited availability of standardized tools, there are important advances in analysis software features (motion correction, cleaning of physiological contamination, group-level analysis, anatomically guided image reconstruction) that can be implemented in the next few years and disseminated to this rapidly growing community. In addition, the next big advance that will transform the technology is wearable fNIRS. By dispensing with optical fibers and placing light emitters (LED light sources) and receivers (photodiodes) directly on the head, wearable devices offer lower weight and higher flexibility than traditional fNIRS systems, with recent developments showing performance characteristics just as good as the standard non-portable systems. Wearable fNIRS will not only enable studies of brain activity associated with natural behaviors in natural settings, but it will also dramatically reduce the cost of fNIRS systems, making the technology accessible to a broader array of researchers and permitting scalability from simple to high-density fNIRS systems. Our vision is to create an open software-hardware ecosystem to promote and support the fNIRS community in the adoption and application of cutting-edge acquisition and analysis technology that meets the needs of our interested users. We will implement and disseminate software advances through our Homer software package and shared near infrared file format (SNIRF) facilitating the translation and utility of fNIRS. We also aim to expand the number of fNIRS researchers by broadly disseminating wearable fNIRS instrumentation that is significantly cheaper than current commercial systems and expands measurement capabilities while maintaining typical measurement performance specifications. Utilizing our decades of dissemination experience, we will establish this resource to rapidly grow the dissemination of fNIRS hardware and analysis software to a broader array of users groups. Further, our resource will become self-sustaining beyond the proposed 4 year grant lifetime. This will ensure a powerful impact on a broad range of applications pursued by our users including those studying normal and abnormal brain development, perception and cognition, neurological disorders, brain trauma, stroke, speech disorders, and motor control.",R24,NS,NINDS,NS,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9431782,R24NS104096,R24NS104096-01,104096,,,2018,1,3467,Josh,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
4381,Designing with Dissemination in Mind: Optimization of a mHealth Physical Activity Intervention for Breast Cancer Survivors,"Increased physical activity (PA) is associated with reductions in treatment-related side effects, cancer recurrence and mortality and increased QOL and survival in breast cancer survivors. However, survivors demonstrate persist, significant post-treatment declines in PA, and the majority do not meet PA recommendations. Most existing studies of PA in survivors are intense, on-site multicomponent interventions that provide little insight into what components are, or are not, effective and have limited potential to be brought to scale. The goal of this Career Development Award is to assist Siobhan M. Phillips, PhD, MPH in her long- term goal of becoming an independent investigator in designing and implementing optimized mobile health (mHealth) PA interventions in cancer survivors to improve health and disease outcomes. Dr. Phillips's short- term goals include enhancing or gaining expertise in PA and cancer survivorship, use of mHealth in PA interventions, Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) methodology and dissemination and implementation (D&I) sciences. In collaboration with her multidisciplinary team of mentors and advisors, she has developed a training plan to reach these goals via coursework, seminars, specialized trainings, independent studies, and a mentored research project. The purpose of the proposed research is to use MOST methodology to develop and pilot test a set of mHealth PA intervention components for breast cancer survivors targeted at social cognitive constructs and designed with D&I in mind from the outset. MOST is an innovative, multi-phase framework adapted from engineering that uses highly efficient factorial experiments to evaluate individual, and combined, effects of interventio components to determine which ones can be reduced, eliminated or replaced to improve efficiency. The intervention components to be tested will be chosen in collaboration with survivors, community partners, and experts/clinicians and pilot tested in a 12-week MOST experiment in 250 breast cancer survivors. The proposed experiment examines the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention components and quantifies their preliminary effects on PA and patient reported outcomes at 12 weeks and 24 week follow-up. This information will be used to assemble a PA intervention optimized to maximize PA and minimize cost and participant burden to be tested in a future trial. The proposed study represents the first systematic effort to use MOST to design an optimized, disseminable, mHealth PA intervention for breast cancer survivors and will lead to an improved understanding of how to effectively change survivors' PA. These findings could result in more scalable, effective PA interventions for survivors, and, ultimately, improve health and disease outcomes. Completion of the proposed research and training plans will provide the candidate with the necessary skills, experience, and preliminary data to launch a successful independent research program focused on PA and cancer survivorship.",K07,CA,NCI,CA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,8947660,K07CA196840,K07CA196840-01,196840,,,2015,1,3486,Audie,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,
4414,Virtual Reality Cognitive Therapy forAlzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD Related Dementias (ADRD) currently affect more than 5.8 million Americans, costing $305 billion in 2020 and causing poor outcomes such as loss of independence, low quality of life, and nursing home requirements. Given the scale of diminished health-related quality of life, the need for non-invasive customizable brain targeting methods to assist AD/ADRD patients is imperative. After the COVID-19 pandemic impact on AD patients, we believe there is a growing need for identifying more effective non-invasive digital Cognitive Impairment (CI) interventions that are easily adapted and remotely accessible within the person's home. ClarityTek proposes to develop Virtual Reality Cognitive Therapy (VRCT) that targets individualized aging needs. This therapy will be structured, based on multidisciplinary evidence, goal-directed, multicomponent, remotely administered, and designed for a broad reach. We will create a tool to restore or reorganize neural pathways to compensate for impaired cognitive function and enable mild to moderate AD patients to adapt to their new situation and improve their QOL. VRCT utilizes a four-pronged approach: Assess, Educate, Treat, and Track. Interventions for AD must consider all facets of cognitive deficits, especially cognitive skills impacting activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL). VR is immersive, isolating the patient from surrounding distractions -- crucial for any CI intervention. VRCT training activities generalized to real life, tailored to engage, adapt, and challenge, will simulate realistic CI-producing scenarios in contexts where these occur. Within VRCT, repeated CI scenario exposure through game loops will gradually train the patients in practical skills to navigate everyday situations: medical appointments, taking medications, shopping, recognizing names and faces, and directions to places. Preserving these skills will improve functional independence. The VRCT intervention aims to remediate IADL specific disabilities. It will include an optional integration that makes possible asynchronous online therapist consultations without face-to-face contact, important during the COVID-19 pandemic. VRCT for Alzheimer's with CI ranked among the world's top 5 innovations in an international digital health competition. In this Phase I project, we will partner with groups at the HealthPartners Neuroscience Center with Alzheimer's research and practice expertise to lead the trial and help design, develop, and optimize VRCT for AD patients. We will incorporate stakeholder feedback to create a patient-centric intervention targeting four specific prioritized CI related to IADL, utilizing the digital therapy development frameworks' guidelines. To guide the project, we will create a multidisciplinary Expert Focus Group. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the feasibility, usability, acceptability, and the initial clinical efficacy of VRCT on 36 AD/ADRD patients with mild to moderate CI over seven weeks. We will conduct three trials, each trial with a cohort of n=12 total n=36 participants. Each trial's results will be applied iteratively in Aim 2 to revise the VRCT, producing the most effective CI intervention. In Aim 2, we will iteratively redesign, develop, unit test, and optimize VRCT with the patients' feedback from the trials and guidance from the Expert Focus Group. We expect to establish that VRCT will be feasible, usable, and acceptable with a Usability Scale success rate of 90%, user satisfaction of 80%, and improved cognition.",R43,AG,NIA,AG,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10385270,R43AG076169,R43AG076169-01,76169,,,2022,1,3519,Tom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
4429,High performance wearable body odor sensor arrays for disease detection and monitoring,"Many diseases, both internal and cutaneous, have distinct odors associated with them, and their identification can provide unique diagnostic clues, guide laboratory evaluation, and facilitate and expedite treatment. Current body odor analysis relies on benchtop instruments, but they are too bulky for use at point-of-care, home or workplace. E-nose technologies provide a simple, light, and low cost alternative for body odor analysis, but they are highly susceptible to environmental changes (e.g., temperature and humidity). Additionally, e-nose suffers from strong cross-talk among the sensing elements when it is exposed to ~100 skin-emitted vapor analytes simultaneously. These drawbacks make e-nose pattern recognition difficult and inaccurate. To overcome this, we propose to develop a wearable micro-gas chromatography (GC) device integrated with graphene based nano-electronic e-nose and vital sign sensors, and use it to analyze body odors related to >20 diseases/conditions. In this wearable device, skin-emitted vapors will be pre-separated by micro-GC and then detected by the graphene e-nose embedded at the end of the GC column to generate time-series patterns. Because vapor analytes will be eluted out one or a few at a time, pattern recognition by e-nose will be much simpler and more accurate. The temperature/moisture issues will also be greatly reduced since the vapor sensors are insensitive to temperature changes. Additionally, the pre-concentrator in the GC is hydrophobic and does not trap water, and the remaining water will be separated out from other vapors through GC. Finally, the vapor concentration inside the GC column is >50X higher than near the skin surface due to the pre-concentration effect. Because of these advantages, the pattern recognition and disease detection capability will be significantly enhanced. Our multidisciplinary team has the needed expertise in biomedical/electrical engineering, data science, and a variety of clinical realms including dermatology, emergency medicine, pulmonology, and pediatrics. We will achieve the following specific aims. Aim 1. Develop and fabricate wearable devices and disposables. We will build 20 autonomous wearable GC devices integrated with graphene e-nose. The wearable device will be small, lightweight (~200 g), battery-powered. We will also fabricate 2,000 customized disposable plastic vapor sampling chambers using injection molding with vital sign sensors incorporated. Aim 2. Develop and implement algorithms to analyze time-series patterns. We will develop the algorithm based on deep learning to analyze time-series patterns and the vital sign data. We will train an autoencoder neural network model and apply it to the features from participants. A regularized classification model will be trained to identify the positive patients. Shapely values will be used to provide explanations for the prediction that the model makes. Aim 3. Analyze >20 diseases/conditions. We will recruit patients from the University of Michigan Health System and then use the wearable devices and algorithms developed in Aims 1 and 2 to analyze >20 diseases/conditions in four different specialties: dermatology, acute care, pulmonary medicine, and pediatrics.",U01,TR,NCATS,TR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10425780,U01TR004066,U01TR004066-01,4066,,,2022,1,3535,Tom,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,
4449,Biological and Environmental Contributions to Healthy Baby Development in Diverse Population,"Children exposed during pregnancy to substances of abuse are also at high-risk for other environmental factors associated with early life stress (ELS). Basic and clinical research shows that these various exposures, individually or in combination, can disrupt early developmental trajectories of brain structure and function and enduring health risk for the child. This R34 HEAL planning grant application from Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA)/University of Southern California (USC) will be vital for consortium hypothesis generation in Phase II in order to disentangle how complex environmental factors impact brain development and function - from fetal period through the first decade - to shape cognitive, social and emotional development. The risk factors for families served by this campus of clinics, CHLA, Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital and Altamed Community Medical Center, is unparalleled in California. Of the families to be recruited, >75% are on Medicaid, more than 50% are below the federal poverty level, and there is enrichment of Hispanic/Latinx of any race. The USC-CHLA team of investigators and bilingual and multi-cultural research staff bring a depth of expertise in recruitment during pregnancy and early postnatal, as well as experimental expertise in epidemiology, neuroimaging, neurophysiology, developmental psychology and behavioral pediatrics, and biomeasures. To ensure maximum protection of a vulnerable population and effective recruitment and retention, the team includes a world- renowned expert in social/legal and medical ethics to complement our experience and community partnerships. For HEAL Phase I, two cohorts will be recruited to meet age range goals. Cohort 1 will include 40 pregnant women and their fetuses/infants to test the feasibility and utility of different study visit schedules on data quality and subject burden. Cohort 2 will include 10 mother-toddler dyads recruited from one of our two ongoing longitudinal studies investigating the impact of early life stress on development. Three specific aims will address the stated goals of the HEAL RFA: Aim 1) to develop the strategies to recruit and retain a racially- and ethnically diverse sample of pregnant women (and their fetuses), who are oversampled for adverse environmental risk factors and exposure to substances of abuse; Aim 2) to develop the strategies for managing potential legal and ethical challenges to ensure that the mother-child dyads have access to legal, social and psychological support services as needed; Aim 3) to determine the optimal study protocol for the planned, phase II study - balancing the need for high quality, longitudinal data collection with the need to minimize burden on the mother-child dyads. The multidisciplinary approaches include fetal, infant and toddler MRI, high-resolution electroencephalography and eye-tracking, promising biosamples (child buccal swab, urine and blood drops; mother breastmilk, blood and hair), and demographic, physical and mental health, social support for mother/child dyads, and behavioral- cognitive measures in children. Lessons learned from recruitment, retention and data collection will be fully shared in order to form best hypotheses and research designs for the Phase II HEAL initiative.",R34,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9900560,R34DA050254,R34DA050254-01,50254,,,2019,1,3555,Tom,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
4465,Randomized Controlled Trial of a Novel Smoking Cessation Application Tailored to Individuals with Serious Mental Illness,"Tobacco use remains at alarming high rates amongst individuals with serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar, and recurring depressive disorders. Smoking tobacco is the number one preventable cause of death in this population, shortening the lifespan of adults with serious mental illness by 25 years and contributing to $317 billion in healthcare expenditures and indirect loss of earnings and disability benefits. Novel and effective models to deliver wider-reaching smoking cessation interventions to individuals with serious mental illness are highly needed and indicated as a priority for NIH. Mobile apps are a promising method to deliver smoking cessation treatments to people with serious mental illness. Despite numerous apps available to use for people with serious mental illness, our feasibility research has demonstrated that using these apps presents daunting challenges for this population. Based on this work, we developed Learn to Quit, a user-centered smoking cessation app tailored to the needs of individuals with serious mental illness. The app's main active ingredient is a novel behavioral treatment that has shown promise as a smoking cessation intervention -- Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. The app provides education about the use of nicotine replacement therapy and recommendations from US Clinical Practice Guidelines to ensure alignment with best clinical practices. In a recent pilot randomized controlled trial (R00 DA037276), comparing Learn to Quit versus NCI's QuitGuide, we demonstrated: (1) high recruitment and retention rates, (2) high levels of user engagement with Learn to Quit, (3) an effective method to conduct a large multi-site randomized controlled trial, and (4) promising cessation outcomes. While this developmental work provides initial evidence of Learn to Quit's usability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy, a large scale randomized controlled trial is needed to test its efficacy in a representative sample of patients with serious mental illness. Therefore, the proposed study will: (1) employ a randomized parallel arm design to compare the efficacy of Learn to Quit vs. NCI's QuitGuide, (2) use rigorous methods to evaluate mediators of app engagement and app efficacy, and (3) examine the cost-effectiveness of Learn to Quit compared to a non-tailored app designed for the general population. The study addresses a serious problem -- high smoking rates among people with serious mental illness -- and proposes to test the efficacy of an easily-accessible smoking cessation intervention, using technology with the potential for high population-level reach.",R01,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9885332,R01DA047301,R01DA047301-01A1,47301,A1,,2020,1,3572,Josh,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
4466,QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring,"Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health.",R01,EB,NIBIB,EB,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,9393045,R01EB025018,R01EB025018-01,25018,,,2017,1,3573,Chris,,,,,,,,,
4467,Development and Evaluation of an Integrated Biomarker Capture System for Use in Remote Trials,"Remote trials are led and coordinated by a local investigative team, but are based remotely, typically in the participant's home. Remote trials offer several advantages over traditional in-person trials including: 1) a wider participant pool, 2) reduced regulatory hurdles, and 3) reduced participant burden. Remote trials face one key methodological limitation: the need for biomarker collection. Over the last decade, a multitude of Bluetooth- enabled remote patient monitoring (RPM) devices have become available which could allow researchers to capture biomarkers remotely. However, several key translational research barriers currently limit widespread integration of RPM devices for remote biospecimen collection. There is need to: 1) integrate RPM devices with existing research data infrastructure, 2) facilitate deployment of multiple devices in any one trial, and 3) flexibly integrate RPM devices into trials across institutions. Directly aligned with the NCATS STTR program, the goal of this Phase I STTR is to develop, refine, and evaluate an integrated digital RPM solution for remote trials (""MyTrials""). To accomplish this goal, we will leverage REDCap, an online research data capture system that is freely available to research institutions. REDCap has 1.7million users across more than 5,000 institutions in 141 countries. Via an established partnership between MountainPass Technology LLC and the Medical University of South Carolina, we will develop MyTrials consistent with feedback gathered during focus groups with end-users and customers. Product development will build upon Dr. Dahne's ongoing NCI-funded R21 (CA241842) in which she has integrated one RPM device, a Bluetooth-enabled carbon monoxide monitor for assessment of smoking, with REDCap. MyTrials will subsequently be improved via iterative usability testing and refinements. We will then conduct a pilot feasibility trial in which study participants (N=48) will be enrolled remotely and randomized to either a self-report assessment only control or use of one, two, or three RPM devices. Main outcomes, which will be assessed weekly across four weeks, include: 1) assessment completion rates, 2) percent of submitted assessments with usable data, 3) product usability, and 4) participant reported feasibility and acceptability. Feasibility and acceptability benchmarks to make a go/no go decision to advance to Phase II include: 1) 80% biospecimen submission rate in each group, 2) 90% of submitted biospecimens with usable data defined as successfully submitted and accompanied by a photo confirming participant identity, 3) high product usability on the System Usability Scale (average of 68 in each group), and 4) end-user self-reported feasibility and acceptability on the Feasibility and Acceptability of Intervention Measures (scores of 4 in each group). Research activities are coupled with strong commercialization opportunities which will propel our company toward Phase II and beyond to improve the feasibility, efficiency, and rigor of remote human subjects research.",R41,TR,NCATS,TR,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,Yes,Awarded,10479571,R41TR004224,R41TR004224-01,4224,,,2022,1,3574,Tom,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
4468,Addressing risk through Community Treatment for Infectious disease and Opioid use disorder Now (ACTION) among justice-involved populations,"Improving HIV and Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) management and implementation for criminal justice (CJ)- involved individuals requires effective approaches to screening, linkage and adherence to integrated services across community agencies and service providers. Community reentry represents a critical opportunity to link individuals to HIV prevention and treatment and OUD service providers. In response to RFA DA-20-028, our proposed study called Addressing risk through Community Treatment for Infectious disease and Opioid use disorder Now (ACTION) among justice-involved populations, is a 5-year Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness- Implementation RCT that compares two models [Patient Navigation (PN) or Mobile Health Unit (MHU) service delivery] of linking individuals recently released from prison and jail to the continuum of community-based HIV and OUD prevention and treatment service cascades of care. A total of 864 CJ-involved individuals who are being released to 2 CT communities (New London and Windham/Tolland Counties) & 2 TX communities (Dallas and Tarrant Counties) with pre-arrest histories of opioid/injection drug use and are living with or at-risk of HIV will be randomized to receive at post-release either: a) a PN system for care, wherein patient navigators will link study participants to community-based service providers during the 6-month post-release intervention period; those without HIV will be provided access to PrEP services, and those living with HIV will receive access to ART services, or b) services delivered via a MHU, wherein study participants will be linked to a MHU within their community where they will receive integrated PrEP/ART, MOUD, harm reduction services on the MHU during the 6 month post-release intervention period. There are 2 specific aims: Aim 1 (Intervention Effectiveness): To compare the effectiveness of the use of PN vs. MHU service delivery on participant length of time to taking initial post-release PrEP (prevention)/ART (treatment) medication within 6 months following release from custody. Secondary outcomes will examine the continuum of PrEP and HIV care outcomes, including (but not limited to) the following additional measures: HIV viral suppression for PLH, PrEP adherence, HIV risk behaviors; HCV measures such as HCV testing & linkage to treatment; sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence (GC/ Chlamydia/ Syphilis and HBV); and primary medical care appointments. Importantly, we will also assess OUD and SUD-related measures: OUD/ SUD diagnoses, MOUD prescription receipt &retention, opioid & stimulant use, & overdose incidents. Aim 2 (Implementation): To evaluate PN and MHU feasibility, acceptability, and costs. Primary implementation outcomes include feasibility (health care utilization impact among released individuals, contributions of interagency workgroup members on outcomes); acceptability (participant satisfaction, perceived usefulness); sustainment (continued utilization), and costs required to implement and sustain the approaches as well as to scale-up in additional communities. Barriers to service access across the community provider spectrum will be assessed as well.",U01,DA,NIDA,DA,National Institutes of Health (NIH),G,5,1,No,Awarded,10154693,U01DA053039,U01DA053039-01,53039,,,2020,1,3575,Leonie,,,,,,,,,
